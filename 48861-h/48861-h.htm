<h2>CHAPTER FIRST</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_e.jpg" width="154" height="153" alt="E" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ENGINE 33 was kept in a substantial
brick building that
stood on a little hill in a pleasant
part of the city. The
brass shone so brightly that
you could see your face in it, and not a speck
of dust or rust was to be seen on any part
of it, as it stood ready for use at a moment’s
notice. Directly over the shafts hung the
harnesses, to be lowered down upon the horses
when they took their places in front of the
engine; and this was the work of an instant.</p>

<p>The floor was just as clean as the engine;
and so were all parts of the building. Three
strong beautifully groomed gray horses stood
in their well-kept stalls, ready to dart out at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the sound of the gong and fall into their
places before the engine.</p>

<p>Not a boy or girl in that part of the city
but thought that Engine 33 was superior to
all the other engines in the big city. She
was always the first at a fire, and she could
throw a stream higher than any of the
others. One boy made a little verse on the
subject, and his companions thought it very
beautiful, for it expressed their views about
Engine 33. This is the verse,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Number Thirty-three</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is fine as she can be.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She’s never late</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And plays first-rate.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Not only did the children think there was
no other engine equal to theirs, but so did
Jack the Fire-Dog. Why, it was <i>his</i> engine!
Jack lived in the engine-house and went to
all the fires just as the horses did. He never
ventured far from the engine-house, but kept
within hearing of the gong that struck the
alarm. How fast he raced back when he
heard that well-known sound, to be ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
start with the engine! So eager was he to
be on hand, that on one occasion when he
could not get the screen door at the head of
the stairs open, he went <i>through</i> it. Sometimes
in winter Jack was harnessed to a little
sled and carried salt for the firemen to melt
the snow on the hydrants, to keep them clear
in case of a fire.</p>

<p>Jack was a dog of no particular breed,
spotted black and white like a coach-dog, but
larger and heavier in build. Those who
knew Jack did not care if he were not a
well-bred dog, they loved him for his intelligence
and affectionate nature. The children
in the neighborhood were as proud of him as
they were of the engine.</p>

<p>Our story opens on a cold evening in
winter. The wind had been blowing fiercely
all day, catching up the light snow and
scattering it wildly about, until it was hard
to tell whether it were snowing or not, so
full of snow was the sharp air. Toward the
latter part of the afternoon the wind began
to go down, but as it grew less the air became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
colder, and the mercury fell lower and lower,
until it reached zero. It went even lower
than that, and at seven o’clock stood at eight
below. A dreadful night for our brave firemen
to work in, but they never fail us.</p>

<p>Below, in the engine-house of Number 33,
stands the engine ready for duty, her shining
brass reflecting a hundred-fold the lights that
shine on her. The horses are warm and comfortable
in their stalls, and still, except when
one gives an occasional stamp or rubs against
the side of his stall. On the floor above,
in their cosey, warm room, the firemen are
assembled. Some are reading, others talking
together. One young man is putting Jack
through his tricks, of which he has a long
list. He has just told to what engine he
belongs,—not in words, for Jack cannot
speak the human language. When he is
asked what is his engine, and the numbers of
several are mentioned, he is silent until Number
33 is called, then he gives a sharp bark.</p>

<p>This evening no sooner has he given his
answer than the gong below strikes, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
an instant men and dog are on their feet,
and on the way to the floor below. Jack
rushes headlong down the long, steep flight
of stairs, while the firemen take a shorter cut
by sliding down the pole. In a very few
seconds the horses have taken their places in
front of the engine, the harness is let down and
fastened into place. The fire is started under
the boiler of the engine, the driver is in his
seat, the men in their places, and the three
splendid grays dash out of the engine-house,
Jack circling about in front of them, almost
crazy with excitement, or running ahead to
bark indignantly at any team that happens
to be in their path. Not long does he keep
up his circling and barking, for by the time
they are at the foot of the hill the horses
have broken into a run, and Jack has all he
can do to keep up with them. He has worked
off his excitement and is ready for business.</p>

<p>Such a stinging, cold night! The engine-wheels
crunch the frozen snow with a sharp,
creaking sound, and the warning notes of the
bugle ring out loud and clear on the still air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes an answering bark comes from
the houses they pass, as the engine dashes
by. No dogs are out on such a night, but
they all know Jack and envy him his position
as engine-dog. It is not always such fun for
Jack as they think it is, particularly on such
a night as this. However, Jack has a duty
to perform as well as the firemen have, and
he does it just as fearlessly and nobly as
they do.</p>

<p>The fire is at one of the extreme ends of
the city, a small theatre in a narrow street
where tenement-houses and small shops are
crowded together regardless of regularity,—a
court here and a narrow alley-way there,
but every square inch taken up with a building
of some kind. When our engine arrives,
it is to find others that have not come from
such a distance hard at work, the deep throbs
of the working engines reaching far through
the crisp air.</p>

<p>Engine 33 takes her stand, and while her
men are attaching the hose to the hydrant
and preparing for action, Jack, as is his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
custom, makes his rounds to see if all is going
on as it should. He sees the horses standing
with their legs drawn closely together under
them, as they always do in cold weather, and
well blanketed by the men who are detailed
for that purpose. Frozen pools and rivulets
are standing on the sidewalks and streets,
and as the water comes out of the hose it is
turned to frozen spray. Jack’s thin coat of
hair does not keep out the cold very well,
and he shivers as he steps over the icy
ground. There is no time to be wasted,
however, and as soon as he is satisfied that
all is in working order, the Fire-Dog joins his
own company. They are ordered into a tenement-house
that adjoins the burning theatre,
and from which smoke is thickly pouring.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the tenement-house have
thrown their bedding and many other articles
from the windows, or carried them down to
the street. Groups of people, lamenting and
terrified, are huddled about their property,
hoping to save it. Scantily clothed in their
sudden exit, they shiver and moan in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
manner pitiable to behold. Many children
are among the number, either in their mothers’
arms or huddled together among their household
goods, vainly trying to escape from the
biting air.</p>

<p>The men of Engine 33 are ordered to the
roof of the tenement-house; and in they rush,
dragging the hose after them, plucky Jack
keeping close behind them. They have no
easy task, for the narrow halls and stairways
are filled with smoke that blinds and suffocates
them. It is slow work, too, for they
must stop occasionally to take breath at an
open window. Sometimes, too, one of them
sinks to the floor, overpowered by the thick
smoke. On they go, however, dragging the
long hose after them, with valiant Jack
always close behind them. At last the
upper story is reached, and the skylight
through which they must reach the roof is
thrown open. Here, however, Jack stops,
and running up to a closed door sniffs for
a moment, and then begins to whine and
scratch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>It is only a kind of store-room, without
windows or any opening to admit the light,
and is built under the stairway leading to the
roof. It seems impossible that any one could
be there, but Jack’s whines and scratching
must mean something, and one of the men
throws the door open.</p>

<p>Through the smoke and darkness nothing
is seen at first; but in rushes Jack, pounces
upon something in one corner, tugging at it
until he succeeds in dragging it to the door.
Then they see what it is,—a child; and one
of the men, the young man who put Jack
through his tricks in the engine-house, picks
it up. Through the smoke and darkness they
make out that it is a boy, tall enough for
a boy of seven, but how thin and light! He
is either in a stupor from the effects of the
suffocating smoke that filled the close room
in which he was found, or else in a faint. At
all events, he lies motionless in the fireman’s
arms.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/i-010.jpg" width="323" height="500" alt="fireman carrying child up stairs, dog at top waiting" />
</div>
<p>It takes more time to write the event than
it took for it to transpire. The other men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
mount to the roof through the skylight, while
the man who picked up the boy forces his
way through the blinding smoke down to the
street, closely followed by Jack. If it were
not for the responsibility for the boy he discovered,
Jack would have followed the men
to the roof, for wherever they went he always
followed.</p>

<p>The young fireman bears the motionless
form of the boy to the street, and singles out
the group of tenants who had succeeded in
escaping in safety from the tenement-house.</p>

<p>“Which of you has left this child behind?”
he sternly asks, looking at the different
family groups crowded together, vainly trying
to keep warm. “Whose is he?”</p>

<p>They are silent, and after waiting in vain
for an answer he continues,—</p>

<p>“If you can’t answer, there are those who
will know how to make you. You can’t leave
a child shut up like that in an out-of-the-way
room without being called to account.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the blind kid!” exclaims one
of the men. “I forgot all about him.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“People are not apt to forget their children
at such a time,” replies the fireman,
looking about him at the children who are
crowding around their mothers. “This case
shall be looked into.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t belong to any of us,” replies
the man.</p>

<p>“How came he to be shut up in that hole
under the stairs, then?” asks the fireman.
“If it hadn’t been for the dog, he’d have
been dead by this time.”</p>

<p>“He followed some of the children home,”
replies the man, “and has been sleeping
there for a few nights. I don’t know anything
about him. I forgot he was there, or
I’d have looked out for him.”</p>

<p>The cold air seems to revive the child,
for he stirs and moans.</p>

<p>“It’s the smoke,” says the fireman. “You
are all right now, ain’t you, young chap?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replies the boy in a faint voice,
but he makes no attempt to rise to his feet.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you up in good shape,” replies
the fireman, carrying him toward the engine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
A wagon with blankets for the horses
stands near by, and a few are still left.
One of these the fireman wraps about the
boy, and lays him on the floor of the wagon.</p>

<p>“Watch him, Jack!” he says to the Fire-Dog;
and in an instant he is back in the
tenement-house to join his company on the
roof and help them fight the fire.</p>

<p>Faithful Jack cast a longing glance after
the fireman’s retreating figure, for it was the
first time he had failed to follow at his heels;
then with a deep sigh he turned to the duty
before him. With one bound to the shaft of
the wagon and another to the seat, he
jumped down beside the still form rolled up
in the blanket.</p>

<p>Jack had heard the conversation between
the fireman and the man from the tenement-house,
and he understood that this was a
child without friends or home, and with another
sigh of disappointment he crept up
to the little figure that lay so still in the
bottom of the wagon. The blanket was
drawn over the boy’s head, but Jack pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
his nose in to see whether the little fellow
were alive, he lay so quietly. He found he
was alive, though, for he started when Jack’s
nose touched his face. He felt very cold,
and the Fire-Dog crept closer still and lay
beside him, hoping to add some warmth to
the cold little figure.</p>

<p>For a time the two lay silently there,
Jack keeping his intelligent eyes open to
everything that went on. He shivered with
the cold, but still kept his post. The horses
stood with heads drooping and tails hugged
closely to them, and the deep, loud thuds of
the working engines stationed near the burning
building seemed echoed by those at work
farther off. After a while the glare and
showers of sparks ceased, and dark volumes
of smoke rose in their stead. Then the
Fire-Dog knew that the fire was out, and
that Engine 33’s men would before long be
released. The engines still played upon the
smouldering embers, however, and it was
some time before he was relieved.</p>

<p>They took the boy with them to the engine-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
for they knew that the homeless
tenants of the empty house could not take
care of him, even if they had been inclined.
He could stay at the engine-house that night,
they decided, and in the morning they would
hand him over to the public charities. So he
was wrapped up well and brought home in
the wagon, while Jack ran along by the side
of the engine. Jack always started out, as
we have seen, bounding and circling in front
of the horses, but he came home sedately.
The excitement was over, and he was as
tired as the men were.</p>

<p>They brought the boy into the engine-house
and carried him up to the warm room
where we first made Jack’s acquaintance.
He was placed in a chair and the blanket
taken off.</p>

<p>“Now let’s see what you look like,” said
the fresh-faced young man who had rescued
him. “How are you now?”</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s hearty,” said the man.</p>

<p>He did not look hearty, though. His face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was very pale and thin, and he did not look
about him as children do who have the use
of their eyes.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see anything at all? Can you
see me?” asked the young man.</p>

<p>“I can see a little mite of light if the
lamps are lighted and if the sun shines very
bright,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are hungry, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not very,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“When did you eat last? What did you
have for supper?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t have any,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, what did you have for dinner,
then?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t have any dinner, either.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t have any dinner, either?” repeated
the young fireman. “When did you
eat last, for goodness’ sake?”</p>

<p>“Some of the children in the house
brought me some of their breakfast. They
were very kind to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, that beats the Dutch!” exclaimed
the young man. “You sit right there till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I come back!” and he rushed out of the
room as speedily as he answered the summons
of the big gong below. In a short
time he was back with his arms full of
packages which he proceeded to open hastily.
In one were sandwiches of thick rolls with
pieces of ham in between, in another a loaf
of bread, some butter in another, and a small
can of milk in another. These he proceeded
to place on a small table which he drew up
before the blind boy.</p>

<p>“There, begin on that,” he said, placing
one of the sandwiches in the boy’s hands.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said the boy; “you are
very good.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t call me sir,” replied the
young man; “my name is Reordan.”</p>

<p>“You don’t intend to have the kid eat all
that stuff, do you, Reordan?” asked one of the
other firemen.</p>

<p>“Why, he hasn’t eaten anything since
morning, and this such a cold day,” replied
Reordan.</p>

<p>“That’s no reason why you should kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
him. He ought to come around to it gradually.
That’s the way they do when people
are starved.”</p>

<p>So the boy was given another sandwich
followed by a glass of milk, and the firemen
and Jack made a lunch off the rest. Then a
bed was made up for the boy in a snug corner,
and he was covered with plenty of warm
clothing. He was so comfortable, from the
warm air of the room and the hearty meal,
that it was not many minutes before he was
in a deep sleep. The Fire-Dog seated himself
near by and watched him earnestly.</p>

<p>“I’d give a good deal to know what Jack
is thinking about,” said one of the men.</p>

<p>“He’s probably thinking over what’s best
to do for the kid, and will settle it in his
mind before he goes to bed himself,” replied
Reordan.</p>

<p>Jack responded by an appreciative glance
and a wag of his tail, that said as plainly as
words could have done,—</p>

<p>“That is just it!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning when the firemen
were up and dressed, the
blind boy was still asleep. He
looked even paler by daylight
than he had the night before,
and his thin cheeks and the dark circles
under his eyes gave him a pathetic look.</p>

<p>“It would be a pity to send the blind kid
off while he looks like that. Let’s put some
flesh on his bones and some color into his
cheeks first,” said soft-hearted Reordan.</p>

<p>“How do you propose to manage? Taking
care of kids and running fire-engines
don’t go very well together,” said the
captain.</p>

<p>“The work sha’n’t suffer,” replied Reordan.
“A chap of his age, and blind at that, that
has looked after himself, won’t need much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
tending, and the little he’ll need to eat won’t
lighten my pocket much.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, keep him for a day or so if
you like, I’ve no objections,” replied the
captain. “Here’s something toward his
keep;” and he placed a bill in Reordan’s
hand.</p>

<p>“We’ll all chip in,” said another. “Here,
Jack, pass around the hat for the blind kid.”</p>

<p>The Fire-Dog took the hat in his mouth
with great alacrity, and gravely went from
one to another of the men, each one of whom
put in some change.</p>

<p>“Reordan shall be treasurer of the blind
kid’s fund,” said one.</p>

<p>“There’s enough already to buy more
than he can eat in a week,” replied Reordan,
shaking up the hat to enjoy the jingling
sound of the coins.</p>

<p>“Please will you show me where I can
wash?” asked a gentle voice; and there stood
the blind kid, who had approached unnoticed.
“If you will show me once, I can find it for
myself afterwards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here you are, young man,” replied Reordan,
leading him to the sink where the men
washed. “Here’s the water-faucet, and
here’s the soap; and while you’re making
your toilet I’ll step out and fetch your
breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Why not take him along with us?”
asked one of the men.</p>

<p>“He isn’t in just the rig for a cold morning,”
replied Reordan. “The looks of the
thing, to say nothing of his own feelings, goes
against it. Wait till he has a hat and coat.
I’ll fetch his breakfast, and while he’s eating
it we’ll go for ours.”</p>

<p>“And when we come back we’ll hear his
story, and see what account he has to give of
himself,” said another.</p>

<p>The boy made himself quite tidy, considering
the poor clothes he had on; and the men,
after seating him at the table with a good
breakfast before him, went out for theirs.</p>

<p>How good it did taste to the poor little
waif! Only hot coffee and buttered rolls,
but it was a feast for the poor child, who for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
several weeks had eaten his meals whenever
he could get them, and little enough at
that.</p>

<p>As the boy sat contentedly eating his
breakfast, a slight sound near his feet attracted
his attention. “Is that you, Jack?”
he quickly asked.</p>

<p>Jack replied by licking his hand and pressing
closely to his side.</p>

<p>“Dear Jack!” said the blind boy, fondly
laying his cheek upon the faithful dog’s head.
“If you hadn’t nestled so closely to me last
night and kept me warm, I believe I should
have frozen to death. Here, you shall have
part of my breakfast, I don’t need it all;”
and he offered the Fire-Dog a generous piece
of his buttered roll.</p>

<p>Jack took the offering very reluctantly, as
if he would have preferred to have the blind
boy eat it himself, but accepted it in order
not to hurt his new friend’s feelings.</p>

<p>“You eat so slowly, I don’t believe it
tastes so good to you as it does to me,
Jack,” said the blind boy, as Jack slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
chewed the soft roll, “and it has butter on
it too. I should think you would like that.”</p>

<p>Jack was trying hard to dispose of a
mouthful his kind little friend had just given
him when the firemen returned from their
breakfast. In fact, Jack <i>did</i> like the bread,
but he thought he ought not to take the
blind boy’s breakfast. He looked really
ashamed of himself when the men entered
and Reordan remarked,—</p>

<p>“Why, you mustn’t give your breakfast
away to Jack, young chap, you must eat it
yourself. We’ve brought him some leavings
from the place where we take our meals, that
he likes a great deal better than what you’ve
got. Aren’t you hungry, kid? Don’t you
like your breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” replied the boy, quickly.
“It tastes splendid; but Jack was so good
to me last night that I wanted to give him
some of it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about him, Sonny,”
replied one of the men. “We’ll look out
for Jack all right;” and he opened a package<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of bones and scraps of meat which he set
before Jack.</p>

<p>“Now, if you’ve had all you want to eat,”
said the captain, who just then entered, “suppose
you give an account of yourself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the captain, after waiting a
moment in vain for the boy to begin his
story. “Where do you come from, and
what’s your name? Haven’t you got any
father and mother?”</p>

<p>“My name is William,” replied the boy,
“William Blake. I haven’t got any father.
He used to go to sea, and his ship got lost
and they were all drowned.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got any mother?” asked
the captain.</p>

<p>The boy hesitated a moment. Then his
lips began to tremble with emotion, and after
making several attempts to answer, he put
his hands before his sightless eyes and burst
into violent weeping.</p>

<p>The tender-hearted men were overcome at
the sight of the child’s grief. He tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stifle the sobs that shook his slender frame,
but his grief was too great for him to master.
The brave men who never hesitated to enter
a burning building to rescue those who were
in danger, who never thought of their own
lives when those of others were menaced,
broke down to see a little blind boy crying
for his mother.</p>

<p>“Is your mother dead too?” asked the
captain in a low voice, a great contrast to his
usual hearty tones.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think she is. I don’t know,”
sobbed the boy.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know where she is?” asked
the captain, gently.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the boy, trying hard to
speak distinctly. “She fell down, and she
couldn’t speak to me nor move, and then
they carried her off in a wagon.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know where they took her?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, they didn’t say anything about
it.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t there any one to look after
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir. There wasn’t any one who
knew me.”</p>

<p>“What did you do then? Where did you
go?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know where to go. Some children
came along and found me crying, and
they were real good to me. They said they
knew a place where I could stay until my
mother came back. So they took me home
with them, and put me in a little room there
was at the top of the house.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage to keep warm in
this cold weather?”</p>

<p>“The children found some things to put
over me. They got some hay from a stable
and made me a bed. It wasn’t very cold
after I got used to it.”</p>

<p>“They probably took his mother to a
hospital,” said the captain, “unless she
was—” He didn’t like to finish his sentence,
for he had not the heart to tell the poor boy
that his mother might be dead.</p>

<p>“Come, little chap,” he continued, “dry
your eyes and put a good face on the matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
We will try to hunt up your mother, and
we’ll look out for you.”</p>

<p>“This is no place for a child,” said the
captain later to the men. “You can keep
him here a day or two, and then you must
turn him over to the charities. Perhaps
they’ll find his mother; at any rate, it is
their business to attend to such cases.”</p>

<p>The men thought this doctrine rather hard,
and grumbled at it somewhat among themselves.
When, however, the next day, the
captain brought in a large bundle, saying
briefly, as he laid it down, “Here is something
for the kid,” they changed their minds. The
bundle contained a warm overcoat, cap, and
mittens.</p>

<p>The blind boy began at once to show the
effects of the kind treatment he now received.
A better color came into his pale
face and he grew stronger every day. With
this improvement of his body, his mind, too,
underwent a change. His face became cheerful
and happy, and he was soon playing
about the engine-house with Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“He begins to seem something like a
child,” remarked Reordan one evening, as
Jack and the blind boy were playing together
at “hide and seek,” and the boy’s
laugh rang out joyously whenever Jack
found out his hiding-place. “If he could
only see, he’d be all right.”</p>

<p>It was astonishing how much the blind
boy could do without the aid of eyes, and
in how many ways he succeeded in making
himself useful. He was never so happy as
when he found he could do something for
his kind friends, and they often called upon
him for little services that they could have
done much more quickly themselves, in
order that he might have the satisfaction of
thinking he was of some use to them.</p>

<p>William was too long a name for such a
small boy, in the opinion of the firemen, so
they used Billy instead. Several days passed,
and yet Billy was not turned over to the
charities. An engine-house seems a strange
place for a child’s home, but Billy soon
thought it the pleasantest place in the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Whenever the alarm sounded, Billy was as
excited even as Jack over it, and after the
engine had clattered out of the house, and
the last sound of wheels and horses’ hoofs
and Jack’s barking had died away in the
distance, Billy waited contentedly alone;
and every one, including Jack, was glad to
see Billy’s face light up with pleasure on
their return. It was a touch of home life
that was very pleasant to these sturdy men
who were denied the privilege of a home.</p>

<p>“You ought not to keep the boy cooped
up in this hot room all the time,” remarked
the captain one day. “Put on his things
and send him out on the sidewalk in the sun.
No harm can come to him if he keeps in
front of the engine-house.”</p>

<p>So Billy had on his new coat and cap and
mittens, and was led down to the sidewalk,
where the sun was shining brightly.</p>

<p>“Watch him, Jack!” was Reordan’s order,
as the Fire-Dog followed them.</p>

<p>So Billy and Jack walked up and down in
front of the engine-house, Billy with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hand resting on Jack’s neck, and the intelligent
dog marching him back and forth with
the regularity of a sentinel on guard. The
fresh air brought the color into Billy’s
cheeks, and he looked very happy and bright.
When they had kept up this exercise for
about half an hour, two persons appeared,
at whose approach Jack showed decided
symptoms of pleasure. He wagged his tail
very fast, and whined with joy.</p>

<p>The new-comers were a middle-aged gentleman
and a little boy somewhat younger than
Billy,—a bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked boy, with
a very independent air, and he carried a
little basket in his hand. The gentleman
was the little boy’s grandfather. I wish I
could describe him as he really was, but the
nearest I can come to it is to say that he
was just the kind every boy and girl would
choose if they had a whole world full of
grandpapas to choose from. Such a pleasant
smile when he looked at you! And such a
pleasant voice when he spoke to you! Why,
you felt happier all the rest of the day after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
meeting him if he only shook hands with
you and said, “How do you do?” His
laugh was even pleasanter still, and he
laughed very often; and when he was not
laughing his eyes were, they had such a
happy, cheerful expression.</p>

<p>Billy could not <i>see</i> the pleasant face, but
he could hear the pleasant voice, and those
who have not the use of their eyes have
something within them that tells them how
people look. So Billy formed a picture in
his mind of the little boy’s grandpapa, and
Billy smiled too when the little boy’s grandpapa
spoke, as everybody else did.</p>

<p>“Jack, Jack, I’ve brought something nice
for you, old fellow,” said the little boy, whose
name was Sam, and who had been eying
Billy very intently.</p>

<p>“What little boy is this?” asked Sam’s
grandpapa. “Seems to me this is a new face.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the blind boy. “I am
Billy.”</p>

<p>“Oh. You are Billy! Well, where did
you come from?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a boy we found one night at the
North End, Mr. Ledwell, and he is blind,”
said Reordan, who stood in the door of the
engine-house and now approached, touching
his hat respectfully. “He didn’t have any
one to look after him, and some children
took him in tow and hid him in a kind
of closet at the top of the tenement-house
they lived in. When the house got on fire,
they cleared out so sudden that nobody
thought of the blind kid. If it hadn’t been
for Jack here, he’d ’a’ been smothered in a
short time, the smoke was so thick. It isn’t
the first life Jack has saved.”</p>

<p>“Good old boy,” said Mr. Ledwell, patting
the faithful dog’s head; while Jack wagged
his tail gently and looked modestly down, for
it always embarrassed him to be praised for
what he considered his duty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sam was unpacking his basket,
and Jack tried to be polite and not to stare
greedily at the tempting contents. He could
not resist the temptation, however, of looking
out of the corner of one eye. What he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fairly made his mouth water. There were
slices of cold meat, none of your thin delicate
ones, but nice <i>thick</i> slices, just the kind every
dog likes, and, most delicious of all, there
was a large bone with tender morsels of meat
on it, to say nothing of several mouthfuls
of gristle. Jack couldn’t help lapping his
chops, as he thought of the good time he
would have gnawing that bone and cracking
it to get at the rich tasting marrow
inside.</p>

<p>Sam handed Jack a slice of the meat, and
he gave it just one roll with his tongue and
then swallowed it whole. Meat tastes better
to dogs eaten in that way,—they think it
takes the taste out of it to chew it too much.
Another and still another slice followed, while
Sam looked contentedly on, enjoying the
operation as much as the dog did.</p>

<p>“I think you’d better save the rest for his
dinner, Reordan,” remarked Sam, with his
decided air. “He can have this bone, too,
then, and I have brought some of the cake
he likes so much. You had better keep that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
for his dessert;” and Sam took out a package
of cake neatly wrapped in paper.</p>

<p>The crumbs that remained in the basket
were emptied upon the snow in front of the
engine-house, and the crumbs from a roll
added to them. Several sparrows seated on
the roof of the building peered anxiously
over, intending to seize the first opportunity
that presented itself to eat them.</p>

<p>“Don’t let the sparrows eat all of them,
Reordan,” said Sam, who had very strict
ideas of justice; “they must save some for the
pigeons. How’s the little lame pigeon?”</p>

<p>“He seemed to be all right the last time I
saw him,” replied Reordan.</p>

<p>“Does Dick the Scrapper fight him away
as much as ever?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, he does hustle him around
considerable when they are feeding and he
gets in the way; but that’s always the way
with animals, you know. The strongest ones
get the first chance, and the others have to
take back seats.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a very mean way,” said Sam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
“I should think you’d stand there with a
stick and keep the Scrapper off while the
lame one eats.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll look after the little lame fellow,
never fear. He’s as fat as a partridge. He
gets tamer every day, too. Yesterday he lit
right on my hand and stayed there quite a
spell.”</p>

<p>“I wish he’d come around now,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“He will turn up very likely before you
go. They come around pretty often. The
sparrows get ahead of them, though, they are
so cute.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sam’s grandpapa was talking
to the captain about the little blind boy who
had been so suddenly thrown upon their hands.
Sam knew what they were talking about, and
he felt sure that his grandpapa would find
some way to make the blind boy happy, for
Grandpapa could do anything, he thought.
Sam felt very sorry that the little boy could
not see, and he looked at him a long time.
At last he said,—</p>

<p>“Hallo, Billy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hallo!” answered Billy in his soft voice;
and the acquaintance was begun.</p>

<p>“Here come the pigeons,” said Reordan,
as a flock of birds came sweeping around the
corner of the street, and alighted in front of
the children. They at once began gobbling
up the crumbs scattered for them, while the
sparrows flew down, and darting in among
them, seized upon the largest ones right from
under the pigeons’ very eyes, flying up to
the roof to eat them in safety.</p>

<p>Among the pigeons was a speckled black
and white one with very pink feet; but one
of his feet he kept drawn up against his soft
feathers and hopped about on the other one.
He did not have a very fair chance with the
other stronger pigeons, for they crowded him
out of the way, and even pecked him when
he attempted to seize upon a piece of bread.
The most quarrelsome of the pigeons was
a handsome dark blue one with rainbow
feathers on his neck that glistened in the
sunlight. This was Dick the Scrapper. He
had a very bold air, as if he had a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
right to the food than the others had. Sam
was very indignant at his treatment of the
lame pigeon, and suddenly drove them all
off except the little lame one. The little
speckled pigeon seemed to understand what
this was done for, and remained behind and
ate a hearty meal. The others were not
much afraid of Sam, for they were very
tame, but every time they attempted to
alight he would shoo them away. This he
kept up until he thought that the lame
pigeon had eaten all he wanted, and then he
allowed the others to return. He picked up
the lame pigeon and it nestled contentedly
in his arm. Billy caressed it too, and
the two children began to talk together,
while Jack stood near by, wagging his tail
approvingly.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Ledwell came back to where the
children were playing with the lame pigeon,
and they heard him say to the captain,—</p>

<p>“This will do very well for a little while,
but of course you can’t keep him here. We
must find some other place for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>These words made Billy feel very sad, for he
had become much attached to his new home,
and thought that if he were sent away, he
would be homeless and friendless again.
The little pigeon who was lying in his arms
heard it too, and his bright eyes saw the
look of disappointment that came over the
blind boy’s face. Jack, too, heard it, and
made up his mind that Billy should not leave
the engine-house unless he went too.</p>

<p>“I rather think that as I was the means
of saving the boy’s life, I have a right to say
something about the matter,” said Jack to
himself. “They all think a great deal of
me, and if I say he shall stay, I rather think
he <i>will</i> stay.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THIRD</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_g.jpg" width="151" height="150" alt="G" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“GRANDPAPA,” said Sam, as
the two walked home together,
“isn’t it too bad about Billy?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” replied
Grandpapa.</p>

<p>“Something must be done about it,” said
Sam; then he walked silently for a while,
thinking very hard. At last he said,—</p>

<p>“Grandpapa, God made me. Did the
same man make you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Grandpapa, “I suppose
he did.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know for certain?” asked Sam,
for Grandpapa’s eyes were smiling hard.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Grandpapa, “of course
I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been thinking it over,” said
Sam, “and I’ll tell you what I’m going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
do. I’m going to pray to God every night
to make Billy see.”</p>

<p>“It will be a very good plan,” replied
Grandpapa.</p>

<p>“You see I always pray for what I want
most at Christmas time,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“And it comes, doesn’t it?” asked Grandpapa.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Sam, “it always comes. I
prayed real hard for a pony last Christmas,
and I got one, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Grandpapa, his eyes
still smiling as he watched the earnest face
of his grandson.</p>

<p>“I asked for a black pony with a star on his
forehead, and it came just exactly right. So,
you see,” continued Sam, “that if I ask
God every night to make Billy see, He will
be sure to do it.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Grandpapa.</p>

<p>“Why, it wouldn’t be half so hard as it was
to hustle around to find just the kind of pony
I asked for.”</p>

<p>“So I should think,” replied Grandpapa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
“Black ponies with white stars on their
foreheads are not so easy to find.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sam, thoughtfully, “I know it.
How long will it be before Christmas comes,
Grandpapa?”</p>

<p>“Only a very short time,—about two
weeks.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shall just tell God that He
needn’t bother about that dog-cart,” said
Sam, with his determined nod. “I shall tell
Him that I would rather He would make
Billy see.”</p>

<p>“That is a good idea, Sam,” said Grandpapa.
“I know you would enjoy having
poor Billy see as you do, much more than you
would to have your dog-cart.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Sam with a little sigh, for
he had been looking forward for a long time
to the pleasure of driving his pony in a dog-cart.
“I can ride him just as well as not.”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached home, and
Sam hurried up the steps, he was so eager to
tell Grandmamma about Billy. Sam’s papa
and mamma were travelling in Europe, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
his little sister Anne, and he was staying
with his grandparents. He was so fond of
them that he was not at all lonely.</p>

<p>“I miss Anne very much, and I should
like to see Papa and Mamma,” he had remarked
to his nurse Mary one day; “but
grandpapas and grandmammas let you do a
great many more things than papas and
mammas do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t say that,” Mary had
replied.</p>

<p>“Mary,” Sam had said very earnestly,
“how would you like to be spanked with a
hair-brush?”</p>

<p>Mary had made no reply to this argument;
and Sam, in response to her silence, had said
with the positive air of one who has had
experience,—</p>

<p>“Well, then!”</p>

<p>On this day Sam found his grandmamma
seated in her sunny sewing-room, and he was
in such a hurry to tell her all about Billy
that he gave her a very confused idea of the
matter. The fire and Jack and the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
blind boy became so mixed up in his story
that it was some time before she understood
the case.</p>

<p>Now Sam’s grandmamma was just exactly
as nice for a grandmamma as his grandpapa
was for a grandpapa, and Sam loved one just
as well as the other. “The only difference
is that Grandmamma was never a little boy
like me, same as Grandpapa was,” Sam used
to say.</p>

<p>“We must see what can be done for the
poor child,” said Grandmamma when Sam
had finished his story.</p>

<p>Then Sam told his plan about asking God
to make Billy see, and Grandmamma thought
it an excellent plan, only that perhaps it
couldn’t be brought about by Christmas,
because the time was very near.</p>

<p>“But don’t you see, Grandmamma,” said
Sam, “that if God doesn’t have to hunt
around for the dog-cart, it will be a great
deal easier to make Billy see?”</p>

<p>So, when Sam went to bed that night, he
said his simple prayer in this way,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, dear God, you needn’t bother about
that dog-cart, if you will only make poor
Billy see as I do; and please take care of
Papa and Mamma, and don’t let the ship
tip over; and take care of Grandpapa and
Grandmamma too, and make Sam a good
boy.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t prayed for your little sister,”
said Grandmamma, as Sam’s prayer came to
a sudden end.</p>

<p>“Oh, Anne sleeps with Nora, she’s all
right,” replied Sam, confidently.</p>

<p>The next day Sam said to his grandpapa,—</p>

<p>“Can’t I go to the park to-day to feed the
birds and squirrels?”</p>

<p>“I think you can,” replied Grandpapa,
“and how should you like to take Billy
too?”</p>

<p>“Why, he can’t see, you know, so it
wouldn’t be any fun for him,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“But <i>you</i> can see,” said Grandpapa, “and
you can lend him your eyes.”</p>

<p>Sam looked so puzzled at this that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
grandpapa explained: “You can tell him
what you see, and he can imagine how everything
looks. He will see the picture with
his mind instead of with his eyes. That is
imagination.”</p>

<p>“It is a very strange thing,” said Sam,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“You see that blind people think so much
about what they cannot see, that they make
a great many pictures in their minds. If
they were not able to do that, they would
be very lonely.”</p>

<p>Then Sam hurried down to ask Cook to
give him some bread for the birds, and to
fill a basket with nuts for the squirrels. He
also took some canary and hemp seeds in a
little package. By the time this was done,
the sleigh had driven up to the door, and
Sam and his grandpapa started on their expedition,
Sam throwing kisses to his grandmamma
at the window so long as the house
was in sight. Then they turned the corner
and soon reached the engine-house.</p>

<p>Billy’s pale face grew quite rosy when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was told of the sleigh-ride he was to have,
and in a moment his warm coat and cap
were on and he was led to the sleigh by
Sam, who took great care of him for fear he
should make a misstep. The Fire-Dog followed
closely at his heels, and watched him
put into the big sleigh and securely tucked
in with the warm fur robe.</p>

<p>“Can’t Jack go too?” asked Sam, as he
saw the wistful expression in the faithful
dog’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Certainly, if he will,” replied Grandpapa.</p>

<p>Jack, however, was not the dog to neglect
his duties, and in spite of Sam’s and Billy’s
alluring calls, he gently but firmly wagged
his tail, to express his regret at being obliged
to refuse their invitation. As they drove
off, he looked mournfully after them so long
as the sleigh was in sight, then he gave a
sigh of disappointment and lay down in front
of the engine-house, where he could enjoy
the passing, and occasionally pass the time
of day with some dog friend, or make the acquaintance
of some stranger passing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the city, for Jack was a social dog. Here,
too, he was within hearing of the gong.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sleigh continued on its way
to the park, the faces of the two little boys
beaming with pleasure,—Billy’s at the unusual
treat of a sleigh-ride, and Sam’s from
watching the happiness of the little blind
boy.</p>

<p>Sam was so eager to point out to Billy
everything of interest to him, that he was
kept busy describing the objects of interest
they passed. The grandpapa’s face reflected
the happiness in the two boys’ faces, and his
pleasant smile grew very tender as he saw
the delight of the blind boy in the scenes his
poor blind eyes could not see.</p>

<p>When, as they passed a group of merry,
shouting boys building a snow fort which
Sam reported faithfully to his little friend,
and Billy, quite excited at Sam’s description
had wistfully asked, “Are they all seeing
children, Sam?” Sam, greatly distressed at
the question, had replied, “There is one
fellow that looks kind of blind,—he’s having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
an awfully good time, though;” then
Grandpapa’s smile grew more tender still,
and he told the two boys about the schools
where those who could not see were taught
to do whatever those who could see did.</p>

<p>“Can they play the way the seeing children
do?” asked Billy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Grandpapa, “and we will
send you to one of them.”</p>

<p>Billy was silent, and seemed to be thinking
about something.</p>

<p>“Should you not like to go, Billy?” asked
Sam’s grandpapa. “The children are very
happy there.”</p>

<p>“I would rather find my mother,” replied
Billy, with a quiver of the lips.</p>

<p>“We will find her, never fear,” replied
kind-hearted Mr. Ledwell, who could never
bear to see anybody unhappy; and he began
a story so interesting that Billy was soon
listening intently and had forgotten for the
time about the dear mother whom he wanted
so much to see. By the time the story was
ended, the houses were farther and farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
apart, then snow-covered fields were passed,
and Sam was kept busy in describing the
frozen ponds where boys and girls were
skating and playing, and the hillsides down
which they were coasting. Then woods with
real forest trees appeared, and Sam explained
that they were now in the park. Here and
there a gray squirrel’s bright eyes peeped
down upon the sleigh, and Sam reported just
how they whisked their bushy tails and ran
from bough to bough, occasionally stopping
to take a peep.</p>

<p>As they went farther into the park, a
colony of sparrows would now and then fly
up from a clump of bushes, and hurry away
as if the sleigh contained a party of ferocious
hunters, instead of two kind little boys bringing
them food. They took care to keep the
sleigh in sight, for Sam and his basket were
old friends, and they knew the feast in store
for them. So they followed at a distance,
for sparrows like to consider themselves
martyrs, and to act as if they were a persecuted
set. This is not to be wondered at,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
when we remember the way they have been
treated. Their nests have been torn down,
they have been driven from one place to
another, and they have been made to feel that
they are not wanted anywhere.</p>

<p>Suddenly there arose on the still, frosty
air discordant cries, and Sam exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“There come the blue jays, Billy! Oh,
you don’t know how handsome they are,
with their tufts standing straight up on their
heads, and their beautiful blue and white
bodies and wings!”</p>

<p>“Are they as big as the pigeons?” asked
Billy, for he had held the little black and
white lame pigeon in his arms and knew just
what size they were.</p>

<p>“Not quite so large as a pigeon,” replied
Sam, “but fully as large as a robin. They
are awfully quarrelsome fellows, though; just
hear how hard they are scolding now.”</p>

<p>“Will they come and eat the crumbs?”
asked Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes, and get the biggest share of them
too,” replied Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/i-050.jpg" width="339" height="500" alt="two children and grandfather walking in snowing wood, sleigh in background" />
</div>
<p>“We had better stop here,” said Mr. Ledwell,
as they came to an open, sunny spot.</p>

<p>So the sleigh stopped, and Sam and his
grandpapa got out and helped Billy out, who
looked as happy and eager as Sam did. He
did not look about him, though, as Sam did,
and see that the sparrows had stationed
themselves on neighboring trees, all ready
to begin their feast so soon as the crumbs
were scattered. Neither did he see the
bright flashes of blue as the jays alighted
on the trees near by, nor the tame and
nimble squirrels who came closer than the
birds, hopping over the snow to Sam’s very
feet. All these things Sam explained, however,
and Billy understood.</p>

<p>Billy, too, threw the crumbs, and held nuts
in his hand for the squirrels, laughing with
delight as he felt the trusting little creatures
eat from his fingers.</p>

<p>All at once arose a blithe song of “Chickadee-dee-dee-dee;”
and a flock of little
chickadees came flying up, quite out of
breath with their hurry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Chickadee-dee-dee-dee,” they all cried
together, as they bustled about to pick up
what crumbs they could; and their song said
as plainly as words could have done,—</p>

<p>“Are we too late? I do hope you have
left some for us.”</p>

<p>They were so sweet-tempered about it,
not even losing temper when the greedy
sparrows darted in and seized crumbs from
under their very beaks, that it was impossible
not to love them.</p>

<p>“Such dear little black caps as they
have!” said Sam. “Here, you great greedy
jay, you let that little fellow’s crumbs
alone!”</p>

<p>A blue jay had snatched a crumb away
from one of the little chickadees, but the
chickadee only replied blithely, “Chickadee-dee-dee-dee!”
which in bird language
meant: “No matter! Plenty more to be had!
A little thing like that does not matter.”</p>

<p>This both the little boys understood the
chickadee to say, for those who love animals
learn to understand much of their language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Then arose a hoarse cry of “Caw! caw!
caw!” and several coal-black crows flew
down at a distance. They did not come
boldly into the midst of the group of feeding
birds, because they preferred always to conduct
their business with great secrecy. One
would occasionally walk on the outskirts of
the party with an air of great indifference,
pretending not to see what was going on;
then suddenly he would dart in their midst
and seize upon a particularly large crumb,
and, hurrying off with it, stand with his back
to the others, eating it in the slyest manner,
as if he expected at any moment to have it
taken away from him.</p>

<p>There was one bird that even Sam’s bright
eyes did not see. He had a timid look, as if
he could not make friends so easily as the
social chickadees. He crept along a large
tree that grew near the spot where the birds
and squirrels were feeding, and creeping in
the same cautious manner on the under side
of a large bough that stretched out toward
the spot, hung head downward, watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
intently what went on beneath him. None
of the birds took the slightest notice of him,
but his quick eyes glanced at them all, and
finally rested on the face of the blind boy,
who patiently listened to the explanations of
the kind friend who loaned him the use of
his eyes.</p>

<p>This shy little bird who watched the two
boys so narrowly, was the nuthatch. As
soon as the sleigh had driven away, the nuthatch
came down from the tree, creeping
along the trunk, head downward, and seized
upon the fine kernel of a nut a squirrel was
eating.</p>

<p>The chickadees were loudly singing the
praises of the visitors who had brought them
such a delicious treat. Even the blue jays,
who were usually very chary of their praise,
had a pleasant word for their friend Sam, who
so often brought them food.</p>

<p>“There was a strange boy with him,”
cawed an old crow. “Who knows anything
about him?”</p>

<p>“He was not a seeing child,” chirped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
nuthatch. “He could not see the blue sky,
nor the trees, nor any of us. Who can
he be?”</p>

<p>“We know all about him,” twittered the
sparrows. “It is the blind boy who lives in
the engine-house. Fire-Jack saved his life;
we see him very often.”</p>

<p>Then an incessant twittering arose from
the sparrows, who were in such a hurry to
tell all they knew that they all talked at
once.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOURTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="155" height="153" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AFTER the two boys had driven
off to the park to feed the birds,
Jack, as we have seen, watched
the sleigh so long as it was in
sight. Then he lay down in a
sunny spot in front of the engine-house door,
where he would be warm and at the same
time see the passing. Dogs, of course, interested
him most, and this was such a
thoroughfare that he saw a good many of
them.</p>

<p>The dogs that interested him the most were
those from out of town who were passing
through the city, following a carriage or
team. It was very pleasant to meet an old
acquaintance in that way, and exchange a
few words with him, for Jack was such a
business dog that he allowed himself few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
pleasures, and did not have the opportunity
of roaming about the city that dogs enjoy so
much. Out-of-town dogs were very interesting
because they didn’t take on any airs, and
often told him things about their country
homes that he liked to hear.</p>

<p>The most irritating of all dogs are the
dogs that are in carriages. They take on a
very superior air that all dogs who are not
driving dislike particularly. In fact, as they
pass, they often make insulting remarks to
the less fortunate dogs who go on foot. Also
dogs who are driving are very jealous of others
who are enjoying the same privilege, and
often talk most impertinently to one another.</p>

<p>Several dogs in carriages passed while
Jack lay in the door of the engine-house,
and they either looked straight ahead and
turned up their noses, pretending not to see
him, or else they made some insolent remark.
Jack paid no attention whatever to them,
knowing that nothing would irritate them
so much as to find that their impertinence
had no effect upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>A large, amiable farm-dog following a
charcoal wagon particularly interested the
Fire-Dog. He stopped a few minutes in order
to tell the little news he had, which was that
the hens were on a strike and had refused to
lay any more until they were furnished with
warmer quarters.</p>

<p>“That accounts for the high price of eggs,”
said Jack; “I thought something was wrong.
Well, I hope they will get what they want.
Give them the compliments of Jack the Fire-Dog,
and tell them to <i>stick</i>.”</p>

<p>“There is one other piece of news,” said
the farm-dog. “One of my neighbors is
missing. He is a little yellow dog with a
black pug nose, and answers to the name
of Toby. Followed his team into the city
with a load of wood one day last week and
hasn’t been seen since. If you come across
him, let us know, will you? The city is
awfully confusing to country dogs.”</p>

<p>“I will be on the lookout for him,” said
Jack. “‘Yellow dog with a black pug nose,
answers to the name of Toby.’ Say,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Jack, as the other was starting to run
after his team, “what shall I do with him if
I happen to find him, which isn’t at all
likely?”</p>

<p>“Keep him till I come by next week, or
send him home if he knows the way;” and
the farm-dog ran after his team, that was now
nearly out of sight.</p>

<p>For a while nothing of especial interest
happened to divert the Fire-Dog. He took
several naps, keeping one eye open to see
what was going on about him. Suddenly
he started and opened both eyes. A group
of children were coming toward him, one of
them leading a dog by a string. Something
about the children attracted Jack’s attention.
They were not very warmly clothed
for the season of the year, but they seemed
happy and good-natured. They were evidently
very fond of their dog, for they
stopped often to pat him and speak to
him.</p>

<p>“Where have I seen those children?”
asked Jack of himself. “I am sure I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
seen them before;” and he tried hard to
recall their faces.</p>

<p>“I have it!” he exclaimed at last. “It
was the night of the fire when we found the
blind kid, and they are the children who
looked after him.”</p>

<p>He looked at the dog the children were
leading. “‘Yellow dog with a black pug nose,
answers to the name of Toby.’ Well, who
would have thought I should hear from him
so soon? Hallo, Toby! is that you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Toby; “but who are you,
and how do you happen to know my
name?”</p>

<p>Jack quickly arose and stepped up to the
little yellow dog. The children good-naturedly
waited for them to exchange the time of day,
during which time Jack managed to explain
to Toby his interview with the large farm-dog.
“I did not expect to hear from you
so soon,” said Jack, “but now that I have,
we must make our plans in a hurry. I
suppose you want to go back to your old
home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course I do. After having a whole
town to roam about in, it isn’t very pleasant
to be tied up in an old shed.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you run away?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t sure of my way. It is terribly
confusing to a country dog to find his way
about in a city. Besides, these children are
very good to me, and I was afraid of falling
into worse hands.”</p>

<p>“You know how to slip your collar, I suppose?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I can, but this strap is pretty
tight,” replied Toby.</p>

<p>“I see that your education has been neglected,
so I will give you a few instructions
given me by an old bull-dog, Boxer by name,
who could slip any collar that was ever
invented.”</p>

<p>“I should be very glad to hear them,”
replied little Toby.</p>

<p>“Well, first you back out just as far as
your rope will allow you to go. Then you
gradually work your head from side to side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
with your chin well up in the air, kind of
wriggling your head free. If your collar is
tight, that doesn’t always work; so next you
lie flat on your back, keeping your nose as
high up as you can get it. You can kind
of ease it up with your fore feet, too. You
do just as I’ve told you and you’ll find yourself
free in time. I stump any one to make
a collar that these rules won’t work on.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best,” said little Toby.</p>

<p>“The bull-dog I told you of, did a thing
once that I wouldn’t have believed if I hadn’t
known it to be a fact. He had slipped so
many collars that they had a sort of harness
made for him with a strap that went back
of his fore legs. Well, one morning they
found that he had slipped that. It beats the
Dutch how he managed to do it, but he did
it all right. It took him all night to do it,
and in the morning they found him all used
up, and lying as if he were dead. He was
quite an old dog then, and not so strong as
he used to be, but you know bull-dogs never
give up anything they undertake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did he get well?” asked Toby, much
interested.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. As I said before, he lay
like a dead dog, and it was warm and sunny
out of doors, so they carried him out and
laid him in the sun. After a while he seemed
to take an interest in things about him,—wagged
his tail when they spoke to him and
all that. Bull-dogs are awfully affectionate,
you know. Then they began to have a little
hope for him, when who should come along
but another dog he knew? There had been
some bad blood between the two, and what
do you think? No sooner does my old friend
catch sight of the other than up he jumps
and runs after him. Of course he was too
feeble to do anything in the fighting line,
but his intentions were good.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t the excitement too much for
him?” asked Toby, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. It did him good,—limbered
him up and set him right on his legs.
Bull-dogs are tough.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know him,” said Toby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
modestly. “He must be a remarkable
dog.”</p>

<p>“He certainly is,” replied the Fire-Dog.
“I should like to introduce you, but the fact
is, we are not on speaking terms now. He
means well, Boxer does, but he’s kind of
jealous-minded. You see it gives me quite
a position to run with the engine, and Boxer,
he feels equal to the business, and it kind of
riles him to see me setting off to a fire. I
suppose he thinks I feel smart of myself and
am taking on airs. It is just as you have
been brought up. Now, if Boxer had been
brought up in the Fire Department, his
natural pluck would have taken him through
the worst fire that ever was. The more he
got singed, the farther he would venture in.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever meet now?” asked Toby.</p>

<p>“Yes, quite often; he lives near by. We
don’t look at one another, though, as we pass,
except perhaps out of the corners of our eyes.
Boxer, he always shivers and his eyes kind
of bulge, and he walks on tiptoe. You know
that bull-dogs are awfully sensitive, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
always shiver when they are excited, but
it isn’t the shiver of a cowardly dog. You
had better look out for a bull-dog when you
see him shiver, for he isn’t in the state of
mind to take much from another dog when
he’s in that condition. He laps his chops
too, then.”</p>

<p>The children had been waiting all this
time, the boy who held Toby by a string
occasionally giving him a gentle pull as a
reminder that it was time to go. They
patted Jack, while they peered curiously in
through the open door at the engine that
stood ready for use at a moment’s notice.
They thought it was time to start for home,
as they had quite a distance to go. So Toby
took leave of his new friend, casting longing
glances behind him as he was pulled
along.</p>

<p>“He appears to be a well-meaning sort of
fellow,” said Jack to himself, “but he doesn’t
look to me smart enough to apply the rules
I have given him. A dog of character like
Boxer would have brought it about by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
himself. However; it’s as well that we are
not all made alike.”</p>

<p>Jack’s attention was before long diverted
from the subject of his new acquaintance by
the return of his charge Billy, who greeted
him so affectionately that warm-hearted Jack
forgot everything else and escorted his charge
into the engine-house to see that he got
safely up the steep stairs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Ledwell and Sam drove
down town to do a few errands. One of
them was to leave an order at a bake-shop,
and as the sleigh stopped before the door,
they noticed a group of children, one of them
holding by a string a little yellow dog with
a black pug nose. They were gazing eagerly
in at the tempting display of cakes in the
large windows, and Sam noticed that the
little dog seemed to eye them just as longingly
as the children did.</p>

<p>Now Sam’s grandpapa was just the kind of
man that any child or animal would appeal
to if he were in trouble, and as he stepped
out of the sleigh and walked by the group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of children, he looked at them in his usual
pleasant manner.</p>

<p>“Mister,” said a voice very timidly, “will
you please to give me a cent to buy something
to eat?”</p>

<p>The voice came from a little girl, the
youngest of the children.</p>

<p>“Why, Maysie, you mustn’t ask for
money; that’s begging,” said the boy who
was holding the dog.</p>

<p>“What do you want to eat, little girl?”
asked Mr. Ledwell’s kind voice.</p>

<p>“Cake,” replied Maysie, emboldened by
the pleasant eyes that seemed to be always
smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, look in at that window,” said Mr.
Ledwell, “and tell me what kind of cake
you think you would like to eat.”</p>

<p>Maysie’s mind was evidently already made
up, for she at once pointed to a plate of
rich pastry cakes with preserve filling.</p>

<p>“That kind,” replied Maysie, promptly.</p>

<p>“Could you eat a whole one, do you
think?” asked Mr. Ledwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Maysie, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Could you eat <i>two</i>, do you think?”
asked Mr. Ledwell.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Maysie, promptly.</p>

<p>“Do you think you could eat three of
them?” asked Mr. Ledwell.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Maysie.</p>

<p>“Well, do you think you could eat four?”</p>

<p>“I’d try,” replied Maysie, confidently.</p>

<p>“Wait here a minute,” said Mr. Ledwell,
“and I will see what I can do.”</p>

<p>The children crowded around the window,
and eagerly watched the young woman behind
the counter fill a large paper bag with
cakes from every plate in the window, the
largest share being taken from the plate of
pastry cakes that had been Maysie’s choice.</p>

<p>Mr. Ledwell glanced at the faces peering
in at the window, following eagerly every
motion of the young woman with the paper
bag. The little yellow dog was no less interested
than the children, and had been held
up in the boy’s arms, that he might obtain a
better view. From this group Mr. Ledwell’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
eyes fell on his little grandson, who was standing
up in the sleigh to see what was going
on, and whose bright face was aglow with
pleasure at the prospect of the treat in store
for the group at the window.</p>

<p>“It would be hard to say whether they or
Sam are the happiest,” said Mr. Ledwell to
the young woman behind the counter, as he
took the paper bag and left the store.</p>

<p>“Or the generous man who takes the
trouble to give so much pleasure to others,”
added the young woman to herself, as she
glanced at his kind face.</p>

<p>“Here, little girl,” said Mr. Ledwell, handing
the paper bag to Maysie. “Now what
will you do with all these good things?”</p>

<p>“We’ll divide them between ourselves,”
replied Maysie, promptly.</p>

<p>“And the dog,” said the boy. “He must
have his share, because he’s seen them same
as we have.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Johnny, of course the dog,” assented
Maysie.</p>

<p>“And Mother,” said the older sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course, Mother,” agreed Maysie.
“Come on!” and off started Maysie, firmly
grasping her bag of cakes.</p>

<p>“Why, Maysie, you forgot to thank the
gentleman,” said the elder sister.</p>

<p>“Her face has thanked me already,” said
Mr. Ledwell.</p>

<p>Maysie, however, thus reminded of her
manners, turned and said,—</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, sir, <i>so much</i>.”</p>

<p>Instantly Maysie was off, followed by her
brother and sister.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” said Sam, as Mr. Ledwell
took his seat in the sleigh, “I think you are
the very best grandpapa in town.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you do, Sam,” said Grandpapa.</p>

<p>“Now, if God will only make Billy see, we
shall be all right,” said Sam, with his decided
nod. “I shall pray to Him every night and
ask Him to, and He is so good and kind that
I’m pretty sure He will do it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIFTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="151" height="151" alt="M" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MAYSIE, firmly grasping her bag
of cakes, rushed through the
crowded sidewalks and street-crossings,
darting in among the
carriages and teams with the
skill that only a child brought up in a large
city possesses. Sometimes she passed under
the very nose of a horse, and it seemed as
if she must certainly be run over, but she
always came out safe and sound. Her brother
and sister, with Toby, followed wherever she
went, but found it difficult to keep up with
her. She was always some distance ahead
of them, and paid no attention to their calls
to stop for them to catch up with her.</p>

<p>“Stop, can’t you?” called out Johnny,
who was leading Toby, and who always
picked him up and carried him across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
most crowded streets. “Stop and divy up!
They ain’t all yours.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to, Johnny,” replied Maysie,
still continuing her rapid gait. “Just a few
blocks more, and then I’ll stop.”</p>

<p>So away they all went once more, little
Toby as eager as the children for the share
that had been promised him. They had
gradually left behind them the pleasant part
of the city where the bake-shop was situated,
and had reached a part where the streets
and sidewalks were narrower and the houses
smaller and closer together. When they
came to a place where building was going
on, Maysie came to a stop, and seating herself
on a low pile of boards, announced her
intention of dividing the contents of the
paper bag. Johnny seated himself by her
side, placing Toby in his lap, and Hannah,
the elder sister, took a seat near by.</p>

<p>They were not a quarrelsome family, and
seemed to feel perfectly confident that Maysie
would do the right thing by them and divide
fairly. They edged as closely to the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
bag as they could get, and took long sniffs
of the delicious odors wafted toward them.</p>

<p>“The dog has got to have his share, too,”
said Johnny, as Maysie had helped them all
around and had not included Toby.</p>

<p>“Each of us can give him a piece of ours,”
replied Maysie, breaking off a generous piece
of hers and handing it to the little dog.</p>

<p>“No,” said Johnny, firmly, “you agreed
to go divies with him, and he heard it, and
you’ve got to do it;” and Johnny hugged
Toby closely to him, while the little dog
looked gratefully into his face and wagged
his tail in response.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Maysie, “he can have
his share;” and she placed one of the largest
cakes before Toby, who ate it in such large
mouthfuls that it had disappeared and he had
lapped up all the crumbs before the children
were half through with theirs.</p>

<p>“He eats so fast,” said Maysie, “that he
can’t get the good of it.”</p>

<p>Toby tried to explain in the animal language
that she was mistaken,—that dogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
had proved by experience that they got
more taste from their food by swallowing it
whole than they did by eating it slowly, and
that every sensible dog ate in that way. “A
few lap-dogs and such as that may nibble at
their food,” explained Toby, “but you can’t
go by them.”</p>

<p>This explanation was lost upon the children,
however, because they couldn’t understand
the animal language Toby spoke in. They
thought he was asking for another cake.</p>

<p>“You must wait until we are ready for
the second help,” said Johnny, at the same
time offering him a piece of his own cake.</p>

<p>Toby tried to make them understand that
this was not what he said, but it was of no
use, they didn’t know what his whining
meant.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if he were cold,”
suggested Hannah, whereupon good-hearted
Johnny unbuttoned his coat and wrapped it
around the little dog as well as he could.</p>

<p>“How can I be so mean as to leave these
kind children, when they share everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
with me?” said Toby to himself. “I do
miss those fields to roam about in, though!”
and he sighed as he thought of his country
home.</p>

<p>At last the cakes were eaten, and one of
each kind left to be taken home to Mother.
These were carefully wrapped up, and the
party started for home.</p>

<p>It was a poor place, their home, but they
had never known a better one, and they
were such happy, contented children that
they really enjoyed more than some children
who have beautiful homes and clothes, and
everything that money can buy; for, after
all, it is not money and beautiful things that
bring happiness. Often those who have the
least of these are the most contented and
happy, if they are blessed with sweet tempers
and cheerful natures.</p>

<p>In the rear of the tenement-house where
the children lived, was a shed. It was a
dark, cheerless affair, but in it the children
had made a bed of some straw that a stable-man
near by had given them, and here they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
had kept Toby. It was not very warm, but
it was better than no shelter; and then Toby
had been brought up in the country, and he
was not quite so sensitive to the cold as dogs
who are kept in city houses are.</p>

<p>“It seems awfully cold here,” said Johnny,
as he looked about the bleak shed. The
door had long since disappeared, and the raw
winter air entered through the large opening.</p>

<p>“He looks kind of shivery,” said Hannah.
“Perhaps, if we tell Mother about him, she
will let us keep him in the house.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she will,” said Johnny,
“because whenever I have asked her to let us
keep a dog, she said we couldn’t afford it,
they ate so much.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try,” said Hannah. “It is going
to be awfully cold to-night. Maysie can tell
her, because she lets her do so many more
things than she does the rest of us.”</p>

<p>This was true. Little Maysie, the baby of
the family, had been indulged and petted
more than the rest, because she had not been
so rugged as they were. When they all had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the measles and whooping-cough, Maysie it
was who had them the hardest. Maysie, too,
had been very ill with pneumonia. Thus
they had gotten into the habit of letting her
have her way whenever any important question
was at hand. So it was not strange
that Maysie, in spite of a happy and generous
nature, had taken advantage of the situation
and become a little wilful. It is quite natural
it should be so, when she so often heard
Mother say, “Oh, give it to Maysie, she
has been so sick, you know;” or, “Let Maysie
do it, because she isn’t so strong as you
are.”</p>

<p>So, when Hannah proposed that Maysie
should be the one to tell Mother that they
had been keeping a dog for the last week,
and ask her to let them take it into the house
to live, Maysie answered confidently,—</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll ask her.”</p>

<p>“That will settle my business,” said Toby
to himself, as the children trooped up the
dark and narrow stairways of the tenement-house.
“No chance for me now to slip my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
collar. So here I shall have to stay, and
good-bye to the fields I love so much.”</p>

<p>The children went up to the very top
tenement of the house, and stopped a moment
before opening the door.</p>

<p>“Give her the cakes before you tell her
about the dog, Maysie,” said Johnny in a
loud whisper.</p>

<p>“Of course I shall,” replied Maysie,
shrewdly. “Don’t I know she will be more
likely to give in after she sees the beautiful
cakes?”</p>

<p>They found the table set for the simple
supper, and their mother busily sewing.
The father of the family worked in a machine-shop,
and in busy seasons the work went on
by night as well as by day; so the children saw
little of their father, who, when he worked
nights, was obliged to sleep part of the day.</p>

<p>The mother looked up as the children
entered the room. Care and hard work had
left their impress on her face, for it was thin
and worn, but it brightened as her eyes fell
on the faces of the happy children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was afraid that something had happened
to you,” said the mother. “What kept you
so long?”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t find the house at first,”
said Hannah; “and when we did find it, they
made us wait until the lady looked at the
work to see if it suited. She says she shall
have some more for you in a few days.”</p>

<p>“And we stopped to look in at the windows
of a fine shop where they sell all kinds
of lovely cakes, and a beautiful, kind gentleman
asked me would I like some, and I said
I would, and he went inside and bought me
a great bag full of the most beautiful ones
you ever saw, and we brought one of each
kind home to you, Mother dear,” said Maysie,
putting the package of cakes in her mother’s
lap.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t ask him for any?”
said Mother.</p>

<p>“N—o,” replied Maysie, somewhat embarrassed.
“I didn’t ask him for cakes,
did I?” she asked, turning to her brother
and sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“You didn’t ask him out and out, but
you asked him for a cent, and he asked what
did you want it for, and you said, ‘Cake,’”
replied Hannah.</p>

<p>“Why, Maysie,” said Mother, reproachfully,
“that is real begging! The gentleman
thought you were a little beggar
girl.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” said Maysie, beginning
to cry. “The cakes did look so nice, and I
wanted to see if they would taste as nice as
they looked. He needn’t have given me
so many. I only asked for just one cent.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t ever do it again, dear,” said
Mother; for Maysie was making herself very
miserable over the affair, and she couldn’t
bear to see Maysie unhappy. “I guess that
there’s no harm in doing it this once. I
don’t wonder you wanted to get a taste of
the nice cakes. It’s kind of tantalizing to
see them before your very eyes and never
to know how they taste.”</p>

<p>“I will never ask any one to give me
a cent again,” said Maysie between her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sobs; but Maysie was never unhappy long
at a time, so she soon regained her cheerfulness,
and came to the conclusion that
she had not done such a very bad thing
after all.</p>

<p>All this time Johnny had been standing
behind the stove, keeping Toby out of sight.
This was hard to do, for Toby was a restless
little fellow, and Johnny knew that if he
should move about much, his feet would
make such a noise on the bare floor that he
would be discovered before Maysie would
have time to plead for him. Johnny at last
succeeded in catching Maysie’s eye, and gave
her to understand that it was high time to
broach the subject; and Maysie, who never
allowed the grass to grow under her feet,
began at once.</p>

<p>“Mother dear,” she said, going up to her
mother and giving her an affectionate hug
and kiss, “we saw a poor little dog who
didn’t have any home, and he was so cold and
hungry! Can’t we just take him in? He
won’t be any trouble at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” replied Mother, firmly, “we haven’t
any room for dogs. They eat a lot, and are
a great bother. No, you can’t.”</p>

<p>“But he is so little he will hardly eat
anything, and we can each of us save him a
little mite from our share every day, and
then you see it won’t cost anything. Do
say ‘yes,’ Mother dear;” and Maysie grew
more affectionate than ever.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mother, firmly, “you mustn’t
think of it. Father would never allow it.
He doesn’t like to have dogs around.”</p>

<p>“We will keep him out of Father’s way,”
pleaded Maysie. “He would be ever so much
company for me when I am sick and have to
stay in, and the others away at school. It’s
awfully lonesome for me then.”</p>

<p>Mother thought of the many days when
little Maysie was laid up with the colds that
always lasted so long and made her so pale
and weak, and she began to give way. It
was true that a little playmate at those times
would amuse the poor child, and after all it
could not cost much to keep a little dog.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The greatest obstacle in the way was Father.
What would he say?</p>

<p>The children, eagerly watching their
mother’s face, saw these signs of weakening,
and were sure that they had gained their
cause. Toby, too, with his true dog’s instinct,
saw it even sooner than the children
did, and before Johnny knew what he was
about, gave a sudden jerk to the cord that
held him. It slipped through Johnny’s fingers,
and Toby, finding himself free, quickly
ran up to the mother’s side, and sitting up
on his hind legs, begged with all his might
to be allowed to stay.</p>

<p>“Mercy on us,” exclaimed the astonished
mother. “You don’t mean to say that you
have brought him here already?”</p>

<p>Toby looked so small and thin, and his
eyes had such a pleading expression, that the
mother’s soft heart was touched. “You poor
little fellow,” she said, picking him up and
stroking him gently, “I think we can spare
enough to keep you from starving.”</p>

<p>“We have kept him tied up in the shed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
a whole week,” said Johnny, boldly, “and it
hasn’t cost a bit more. I wouldn’t mind
being a little hungry myself, to save something
for him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it will be necessary to go
so far as that,” replied Mother. “What
troubles me most is to keep him from annoying
Father. You know he isn’t fond of
dogs, and he mustn’t be troubled when he
works so hard.”</p>

<p>“He is a real quiet dog,” said Johnny. “I
don’t believe he will disturb him a mite.”</p>

<p>So Toby’s fate was settled, and he had a
good supper and a share of the cakes besides,
for Mother could not be prevailed upon to
eat them all herself, and divided them with
the others, Toby included.</p>

<p>Then came the important question of sleeping
quarters. The cold shed was not to be
thought of, and it ended by the indulgent
mother consenting to his sleeping at the foot
of Johnny’s bed. This was good news for
Toby, who was always lonesome when he had
to sleep all by himself. So the dog’s heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was no less happy than the children’s, and
they all went cheerfully to bed so soon as it
was decided what was to be done with Toby.</p>

<p>Johnny’s room was small and dark, not
larger than a good-sized closet, but it seemed
as luxurious as a palace to little Toby after
the dark, cold shed. He was put to bed at
Johnny’s feet after an affectionate leave-taking
by the two girls. For a while he lay
very still, but as soon as Johnny was asleep,
he crept toward the head of the bed, and at
last settled himself so closely to the sleeping
boy that he could lick the hand that lay outside
the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>“You are so kind to me,” said Toby to
himself, “that I don’t believe I should have
the heart to run away, even if I could. I
should like to get a glimpse of the beautiful
fields, though.”</p>

<p>So saying, the grateful little dog closed his
eyes, and in a few moments he, too, was fast
asleep, and dreaming that he was racing over
his beloved fields, with Johnny close at his
heels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIXTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_k.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="K" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">KIND-HEARTED Mr. Ledwell
had already started inquiries
concerning the blind boy’s
mother. In a large city where
there are so many institutions
for receiving these unfortunate cases, this
takes much time. Then, at the time the sick
woman was taken away, she was unconscious,
and, if she were still living, perhaps she was
still too ill to tell her name. Mr. Ledwell
also consulted an oculist in regard to Billy’s
eyes, and he expressed an opinion that Billy’s
sight might be restored. First, however, there
must be an operation, and, to prepare for that,
Billy must have the best of care, in order to
become as strong as possible. Life in an
engine-house, kind as the men were to him,
was not the place to bring this about. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ought to have a woman’s care,—one who
would bathe and dress him, and give him the
most nourishing food to eat.</p>

<p>Such a woman Mr. Ledwell found. She
had been nurse to Sam’s father, and had
received so many kindnesses from the family
that she was only too happy to return some
of the favors she had received from them.
She was now a widow, and lived in a quiet
street not very far from the engine-house.</p>

<p>At first Billy took the idea of the change
very much to heart. He couldn’t bear the
thought of leaving his kind friends and Jack.
He was a very obedient little fellow, though,
and when the state of affairs was explained
to him, and he was promised frequent visits
from his friends, Jack included, he tried to
make the best of it.</p>

<p>“Only think, Billy, you will be able to see
the blue sky and the faces of your friends,”
said Mr. Ledwell, “and your good friend
Jack who saved your life; and by and by
we shall find your mother, and you can see
her, which will be the best of all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Billy had used the eyes of others for so
long that he did not realize how much he
should gain; but he tried to be as cheerful as
possible, because he wanted to please those
who had been so good to him.</p>

<p>One morning Mr. Ledwell and Sam called
to take him to his new home. As Reordan
dressed his little friend for the last time, it
was well that Billy could not see; for the
tender-hearted fireman was so sorry to part
with his little charge that he looked very sad.
Although Billy could not <i>see</i> the grief in
Reordan’s face, he felt it in the tones of his
voice and in the gentle touch of his hand,
and the tears were running down the blind
boy’s face. This sight was too much for
tender-hearted Reordan, whose own eyes
began to look very moist.</p>

<p>Sam looked from one to the other, and his
usually bright, happy face grew serious. He
tried hard to keep back the tears, but they
would come, in spite of the effort he made.
At last, with the tears running over his
cheeks, he burst out,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t see what there is to cry about.
I am praying to God to make Billy see, and
I know He will do it.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Sam,” said his grandpapa.
“There <i>isn’t</i> anything to cry about. Billy
is going to a pleasant home, and by and by
he will see us all, and we shall find his
mother, and he will be as happy as he
can be.”</p>

<p>Jack all this time had been eagerly watching
the faces about him. He could never
bear to see anybody unhappy, and there he
sat, softly crying to himself, and doing his
best not to make any noise about it. He
looked as if he wanted to remind them that
all would come out right in the end, but they
were not thinking of him. So, when Mr.
Ledwell expressed exactly what Jack wanted
to say, he could not contain himself any
longer and broke into a loud howl.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Reordan, “now that
we have set Jack going, I guess it’s about
time for us to stop. You’re all right, aren’t
you, Kid?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Y—s,” sobbed Billy.</p>

<p>“So there isn’t any need to worry. Come
on, Kid!” and suddenly catching up the little
boy, Reordan seated him upon one of his
broad shoulders, and set off at a rapid gait
for the sleigh.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Kid! Come and see us soon!”
the firemen called out; and the blind boy
answered their good-byes all the way to the
sleigh.</p>

<p>There was such a bustle in starting, the
horses, who had grown impatient at waiting,
setting the sleigh-bells a-ringing as they
pawed the snow and fidgeted about in their
harnesses, that Billy grew quite excited,
and became cheerful again. He waved his
farewells as the sleigh drove off, and called
out “Good-bye” so long as his voice could
be heard.</p>

<p>“Poor little kid!” said Reordan; “I
wouldn’t have believed that it would be so
hard to part with him.”</p>

<p>Jack looked after the sleigh with sad eyes
and drooping tail, then silently went back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the engine-house and lay down where he
could hear the bell if it struck. He hoped it
would, for Jack was so strictly business-like
that he never liked to give way to his feelings.
He lay still for some time, thinking of
Billy’s pleasant ways and the good company
he always was, and he grew sadder and
sadder. Hardest of all was it to hear the
firemen say that they didn’t believe the
operation on his eyes would be successful,
and that he would probably always be blind.
Jack was beginning to think that he would
not be able to bear the suspense much longer,
when all at once the gong in the engine-house
struck.</p>

<p>In an instant the firemen and Jack were
all on their feet, every thought of the blind
boy lost in the hurry and excitement of starting
to the fire. A minute more, and the
engine was on its way, the horses dashing
along at full speed, with Jack tearing madly
ahead, the notes of the bugle clearing the
crowded streets as if by magic.</p>

<p>It was a hard fire to fight, for the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was high and lightly built, and by the time
our engine reached the spot, flames were
pouring out of the lower stories. Ladders
were placed against the burning building,
and the firemen mounted them to reach the
roof. Among the men on the roof were those
of Engine 33. Jack watched them hard at
work, and longed to be with them. Sometimes
they had carried him up the ladders,
but not to such a height as this.</p>

<p>Jack felt hurt and neglected, for was he not
one of the company? He was anxious, too,
for how could they manage without him?
It would not look well if any of his friends
should see him standing there safely on the
ground, while the lives of the rest of the
company were in danger. Jack would have
preferred to walk into the midst of the blaze
rather than be thought a coward.</p>

<p>All at once a thought struck him. The
next building was of the same height as the
burning one. Jack remembered that when
a building was burning in the lower stories,
so that the firemen could not enter it, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
often reached the roof through a neighboring
one. The Fire-Dog always acted promptly,
and in an instant he was at the door of the
adjoining building. It was an hotel, and he
had not many seconds to wait before some
one came out. In a twinkling in crowded
Jack, before the door had time to swing
back, and he was on his way to the stairs.</p>

<p>In the excitement caused by the fire, nobody
noticed a strange dog hurrying through
the halls and up the stairways, and Jack soon
reached the upper story. The firemen were
there before him, and the skylight through
which they had gone was left open. They
were playing on the roof of the hotel as well
as into the burning building.</p>

<p>Jack crossed over the streams of water
that were running over the roof, and joined
his company. Keeping as close as possible
to his particular friend Reordan, he followed
his every movement; and Reordan, hard at
work, with no thought for anything but the
duty before him, was glad of the dog’s company.
This feeling was not expressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
words, but a glance of his eye as the Fire-Dog
found him was as good as words for
faithful Jack, who held himself ready to share
the fireman’s fate, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>While hard at work, the chief espied Jack.
“How did that dog get up here?” he asked
in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Up the ladder, sir,” replied Reordan,
promptly; for he never lost an opportunity
to show off Jack’s intelligence.</p>

<p>“Well, that beats the Dutch,” said the
chief. “It isn’t natural for a dog to mount
ladders. He’ll come to a bad end.”</p>

<p>“The chief doesn’t like Jack,” said Reordan
to himself. “I must keep him out of
his way, or there’ll be an order to get rid of
him. Keep close, Jack, old boy!”</p>

<p>Jack too understood by the chief’s tone
and by the expression of his face that he
was no favorite with him, for dogs often <i>feel</i>
the way people think of them even more
than people do. “I shall take care to keep
out of <i>his</i> way,” said Jack to himself, as he
followed his friend Reordan about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The firemen’s work was over at last, and
Jack betook himself to the street by the way
he had come, and by the time his company
had reached the street there was Jack,
standing by the horses’ heads ready to start.
The men, wet and tired, jumped upon the
engine, and they started for home, Jack
trotting leisurely along the sidewalk, as was
his custom after a fire. Now that the excitement
of the fire was over, he was beginning
to think how lonely it would be in the
engine-house without his little companion
Billy.</p>

<p>“Nobody there to hug me and say, ‘Glad
to see you back, you brave old Jack! I
wonder if you saved any little boy’s life
to-day, Jack.’ No, I shall not hear those
pleasant words any more. How lonesome
it will be!”</p>

<p>With these thoughts in his mind, whom
should he see coming towards him but his
old friend the bull-dog Boxer? He was a
white dog, and he usually looked very clean,
for he was always bathed once a week. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
had told Jack about it, for he didn’t enjoy
the operation, they scrubbed him so hard
and used carbolic soap, which was very disagreeable
to him. They usually managed to
let some of the suds get into his eyes, and
it made them smart dreadfully. This bath
always took place on Monday, after the
maids were through washing, and Jack
smiled to himself as he recalled how Boxer
often managed to be out of the way when
washing morning came around. This was
Monday morning, and Jack said to himself,
“I’d be willing to bet a good-sized bone that
Boxer got around that bath to-day.”</p>

<p>It certainly looked as if he had, for Boxer’s
white coat looked very dingy against the
white snow. It looked rough, too, and there
was an ugly gash over one of his eyes.
“He’s been in a fight,” said Jack to himself.
“I don’t doubt he’s been having a beautiful
time.”</p>

<p>So soon as Boxer espied Jack coming
towards him his whole appearance changed.
His tail stood up straight and stiff, his hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rose in a ridge along his spine, and he walked
on tiptoe as if he were treading on eggs and
didn’t want to break them. His eyes grew
fierce-looking and seemed to bulge more
than ever, although he had naturally very
full eyes. He licked his chops, too, and
seemed to swell to twice his usual size. All
the time he looked straight ahead as if he
didn’t see Jack at all.</p>

<p>“Now this is too absurd, to keep up such
a feeling,” said Jack to himself, for thinking
about little Billy had put him in a very soft
mood. So he stopped just as he was opposite
his old friend.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Boxer!” he called in a pleasant
voice.</p>

<p>Boxer, however, did not return the salutation,
although he settled down to a walk and
seemed to be shivering.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that such old friends as
we ought not to pass one another in this
way. What’s the use in quarrelling? Life
is too short for that. Come over this afternoon
and see me. I’ve got some fine bones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that have been buried a long time, and they
must be about mellow by this time. Come
over, and we’ll try ’em and talk over old
times together.”</p>

<p>While Jack was making this amiable
speech, Boxer was walking on tiptoe in a
circle about him, and looking at him out
of the corners of his eyes. When a dog
does that it means that he wants to pick a
quarrel, and he holds himself ready to spring
on the other dog at the first disagreeable
word he utters. Jack, however, would not
utter that word, he was determined to make
peace.</p>

<p>“There are no friends like old friends,”
said Jack, pleasantly, “and I can’t afford to
lose any of mine. Don’t let a few hasty
words keep us apart any longer. I’m sure
I’m sorry for my part of the affair, and I
can’t say any more than that.”</p>

<p>Boxer stopped walking about in circles, and
seemed to be swallowing something that stuck
in his throat. The ridge on his back went
down, too, and his tail didn’t stand up as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
stiffly. These are signs that a dog has given
up his intention of fighting.</p>

<p>“The quarrel was not of my making,” he
growled at last.</p>

<p>“I’m willing to take all the blame of it,”
replied Jack, who was thankful to find his old
friend coming around, for he knew that a
bull-dog couldn’t be expected to do this at
once. “I’ve lots to tell you. You don’t
know anything about the blind kid who’s
been stopping with us. I’ll tell you about
him and about the little yellow dog Toby
who was lost, and how I happened to come
across him. I gave him your rules about
slipping a collar. You know you taught
them to me. I doubt if he’s a dog of enough
character to carry it out. He looked kind
of weak in his mind.”</p>

<p>“If he’s that kind of a dog, he’d better
stay where he is,” growled Boxer.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t wonder if he did,” replied
Jack, “but we’ll see. He seemed to have
a great respect for you when I told him about
you, and said he should like to meet you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>This was very gratifying to Boxer’s feelings,
and his reserve began to thaw still more.
Good-natured Jack saw the advantage he had
gained, and took his leave, saying,—</p>

<p>“Well, be sure and come over this afternoon
and we’ll talk things over. The blind
kid’s story is very interesting. I should
like to do something for him, and we’ll think
what can be done. Two heads are better
than one, you know, and yours is worth more
than mine any day.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come around if I find time,” replied
Boxer, for Jack’s tactful words had done
their work, and Boxer’s voice had lost so
much of its growl that it sounded quite
natural again.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, then,” said Jack; and Boxer
responded cheerfully, for at heart he was
glad to be at peace with his old friend,
although his nature was such that he could
not have brought it about by himself, even if
Jack had met him two-thirds of the way.</p>

<p>“Now he’ll go home and have his bath,
and it will cool his brain, and he will be all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
right by afternoon,” said Jack to himself, as
he betook himself to the engine-house. “He
gave in pretty well for a bull-dog, and it didn’t
hurt me a bit to take more than my share of
the blame. My shoulders are broad enough
to bear it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVENTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="154" height="152" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is time to follow the little
blind boy to his new home.
After a short time the sleigh
turned into a quiet, narrow
street and stopped before a
small house. There was a look of unusual
neatness about it, from the carefully brushed
steps to the freshly washed windows and
spotless curtains. The small bay window
of the front parlor was filled with plants and
trailing vines, and in the midst of them hung
a shining brass bird-cage, the bird singing
so loudly that his blithe voice reached the
ears of the occupants of the sleigh.</p>

<p>The front door was thrown open, not just
far enough for a person to enter, but <i>wide</i>
open as if in welcome, and in the doorway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
stood a stout woman with gray hair and a
motherly, smiling face.</p>

<p>“Here is the new boy I have brought
you, Mrs. Hanlon,” said Mr. Ledwell, “and
I think you will find him as good as they
make them.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I shall, sir,” she replied in a
cheery voice that just suited her pleasant
face; as she looked down at the blind boy’s
patient face, she added to herself, “poor
little soul!”</p>

<p>“You must manage to make him as plump
and rosy as Sam is,” said Mr. Ledwell. “If
you can’t do it, I don’t know who can.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best, sir, never fear,” replied
Mrs. Hanlon; “but come in out of the
cold, sir. I hope you will be satisfied with
the room I’ve fixed up for the little boy.
I took the front chamber up one flight, because
you said he must have all the sun he
could get, and the furniture you sent for it
is beautiful.”</p>

<p>She led the way upstairs, holding Billy
fast by the hand. The blind boy’s keen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
instinct, as soon as he heard the pleasant
voice and felt the kind touch of her hands,
told him into what motherly care he had
fallen, and he followed her with perfect confidence.
She opened the door of the chamber
that was now to be his, and even Sam,
accustomed to every luxury in his beautiful
home, thought this one of the prettiest rooms
he had ever seen.</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy,” he exclaimed excitedly, “you
don’t know how pretty it is. There’s a little
white bed with beautiful pink roses all over
it, and a little white bureau, and white
chairs, and there are pretty white curtains at
the windows tied back with pink ribbons;
and there are such be-au-ti-ful plants in the
window, and there are real nice pictures
hanging around. There’s a dog that looks
just like Fire-Jack.”</p>

<p>“This is your own little room, Billy,” said
kind Mr. Ledwell, “and I hope you will
be very happy here. Before long, you know,
you will be able to see for yourself how everything
looks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sam, eagerly, “it’s only a few
days now until Christmas, and I’m praying
away like everything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the dear child!” said Mrs. Hanlon,
watching Sam’s excited face.</p>

<p>“It may not come quite so soon as Christmas,
Sam,” Grandpapa said.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it will, Grandpapa,” replied Sam,
confidently. “It’s to be my Christmas
present, you know. Didn’t my little pony
come when I asked for it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope it will,” answered Grandpapa,
“but you mustn’t be disappointed
if it doesn’t come the very day you expect
it.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course it will! You see if it
doesn’t!” said Sam, with his decided nod.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hanlon had indeed made a very attractive
room with the aid of the furniture Mr.
Ledwell had so generously given. “He is
one who never does anything by halves,”
Mrs. Hanlon had said, when she saw the neat
white furniture. A cheap, brightly figured
spread for the bed and simple curtains for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
windows, in which she placed a few of her
many plants, made a pretty, cosey room. Mr.
Ledwell had also sent a few pictures of children
and animals that would take the fancy of
any boy or girl.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Ledwell, at last, “now
that we have seen Billy so comfortably settled
in his new home, we must be thinking about
our own home. Grandmamma will think we
are lost if we are not in season for lunch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I don’t think she will,” answered
Sam.</p>

<p>Then Grandpapa saw that Sam evidently
had something on his mind, because he was
not ready to start, as he usually was. “What
is it, Sam?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am thinking that it will be kind of
lonesome here for Billy the very first day,”
replied Sam. “Couldn’t I stay to lunch
with him?”</p>

<p>“I think it would be more polite to wait
till you are invited, Sam,” said Mr. Ledwell.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/i-106.jpg" width="335" height="500" alt="Mrs. Hanlon standing by the two children seated at the table" />
</div>

<p>“Oh, do let him stay to dinner, sir,” said
Mrs. Hanlon, eagerly. “He hasn’t been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
here for a long time, and I have missed him
dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it will put you to too much
trouble,” answered Mr. Ledwell.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, sir, it’s no trouble at all.
It’s a real pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are sure he will not be in
the way, I will leave him.”</p>

<p>So Sam was allowed to stay to lunch, with
Billy, and it would be hard to say which was
the more pleased with the arrangement.</p>

<p>One of the greatest treats Sam knew, was
to occasionally make a visit to this old friend
of the family. He was treated like a king on
these visits, for Mrs. Hanlon thought that
nothing could be too good for the son of the
baby she had nursed. She always cooked the
dishes she knew he liked, and then followed
what he liked best of all,—stories about his
papa when he was a little boy.</p>

<p>“I think these are the very prettiest dishes
I ever saw,” said Sam, as they sat down at
the neatly spread table in the cosey dining-room.
“I wish we had some just like them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“They ain’t much by the side of the beautiful
ones you have at home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they are,” replied Sam. “You
ought to see them, Billy. They’ve got
beautiful red and yellow flowers painted all
around the edges.”</p>

<p>“Things always look and taste better to
us when we’re out visiting than when we’re
at home,” said Mrs. Hanlon. “I don’t see
what makes you like to come here so well,
Sam, when you have everything so nice at
home.”</p>

<p>“I like your <i>food</i>,” replied Sam, “it is
a great deal nicer than what we have.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” exclaimed Mrs. Hanlon.</p>

<p>Somehow it happened that the dinner was
what Sam liked best, and he thought it very
strange; but Mrs. Hanlon wanted the little
blind boy to feel at home as soon as possible,
and she had what she thought the boys would
like.</p>

<p>There was beafsteak that Sam liked so
much, and baked potatoes, that Mrs. Hanlon
always let him open and spread himself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
sweet cranberry sauce, exactly the way he
liked it, and hot biscuits, as white and fluffy
as cotton wool when he broke them open, so
much nicer than the cold rolls or bread and
butter he had at home. Then, when they
had eaten all these things, there was a nice
little pudding with the cold, hard sauce Sam
liked so well.</p>

<p>The best part of this was that Sam was
allowed to prepare his own food all by himself,
instead of having it cut up for him just
as if he were a baby. To be sure, his knife
sometimes slipped when he was cutting his
meat, and a little gravy would be spilled on
the white tablecloth; and once or twice a
piece of meat flew off his plate and lighted
in the middle of the table, but Mrs. Hanlon
didn’t care one bit, and she thought he did
splendidly, so Sam didn’t feel badly at all
about it.</p>

<p>Poor Billy had to have his food prepared
for him, but he managed to feed himself very
well, and everything tasted as good to him
as it did to Sam. There was very little talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
during the dinner, both boys were so
hungry, but when they were through and
Mrs. Hanlon was washing the dishes in the
little pantry, they followed her there. Sam
told her all about the Christmas presents he
was to give, all except the one he had for
her, and he told her she must hang up the
very largest stocking she had, and he was
afraid the present wouldn’t go in then. She
must hang up one for Billy, too, he said,
because he would have some presents.</p>

<p>“Does Santa Claus bring all the presents,
Sam?” asked poor little Billy, whose experience
in presents had been very limited.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Sam, very decidedly, “I
don’t believe he does. Why, he couldn’t
get around to all the places, you know.
Even God Himself would have to hustle.”</p>

<p>“Did I ever tell you what your papa did
one Christmas, Sam?” asked Mrs. Hanlon.</p>

<p>“No, you never did. Do tell us, please.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Hanlon, as she wrung
out her dishcloth, “you two boys go into
the parlor, and just as soon as I get my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
dishes put away I’ll come in and tell you
about it.”</p>

<p>So the two boys went into the parlor to
wait for the promised story, and Sam, to
while away the time, told Billy about the
present he had for Mrs. Hanlon, first extracting
a solemn promise that he would keep the
secret to himself, and not on any account
breathe a word of it to Mrs. Hanlon. Billy
having pledged his word, Sam in a loud
whisper, which could easily have reached the
ears of their hostess if she had happened to
be listening, explained that his Grandmamma
had bought a warm fur muff for her, and
that he had bought her a beautiful necktie,
all with his own money which he had saved
for the purpose.</p>

<p>“Now be sure you don’t tell her, Billy, for
it would spoil all her pleasure if she knew what
was coming;” and Billy once more promised
solemnly not to breathe a word about it.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t hint, either, Billy, for that
is just as bad; she might guess, you know;”
and Billy promised to be on his guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon Mrs. Hanlon came in, and seating
herself in her sewing-chair, took up some
mending and announced that she was ready
to begin her story. Sam drew a low chair
close to hers for Billy, seating himself directly
in front of her, where he could keep his eyes
on her face and not lose a single word.</p>

<p>“We’re all ready, Mrs. Hanlon,” said Sam,
hitching his hassock a little nearer in his
impatience to have her begin.</p>

<p>“Well, Sam, when your papa was a little
boy younger than you are, he had a little
bank made of iron and painted to look just
like a real bank where they keep money.
It had a chimney on top with a hole big
enough to drop a nickel in, and he used to
save all he got and drop them in that way.
He said he was going to keep putting them
in until it was full, and then he was going
to open it and buy Christmas presents with
the money. It would have taken a bank as
big as the State House to hold nickels enough
to buy all the presents he promised. He was
going to give me a gold watch and chain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
ever so many other things that cost ever
so much. And he was going to give Cook
a silk dress and a pair of gold spectacles, and
if he had money enough he said he should
buy her a little horse and carriage to take
her to church in, because she had grown kind
of lame standing on her feet so much cooking.
He had promised all the others just as handsome
presents, and he was so happy talking
about them that we enjoyed them as much
as if we really had them.</p>

<p>“Well, a few days before Christmas he
was out walking with me, and we passed a
store not far from where we lived that was
full of beautiful candy of all kinds. In
front of the windows there was a group of
poor children looking in and enjoying the
bright paper boxes and plates piled up with
tempting candy.</p>

<p>“They were all talking together and saying
what kinds of candy they would give one
another if they had money enough to buy it.
They looked real happy, too, choosing the
candy they didn’t have any money to buy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Poor things!’ I said, ‘I don’t suppose
they will have any Christmas presents at
all.’</p>

<p>“‘Haven’t they got any money at all?’
your papa asks.</p>

<p>“‘No, I don’t suppose they ever had a
cent of their own, unless somebody gave it
to them.’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t they ever have any candy at
all, or any Christmas presents?’ asks your
papa.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t believe they do,’ I answers, ‘but
they look just as happy as if they did, and
candy isn’t good for little folks, it makes
them sick.’</p>

<p>“‘It doesn’t make me sick,’ says your
papa, ‘and it tastes real good.’</p>

<p>“He looked very hard at the children, and
I could see he felt very badly about their not
having any candy, and pretty soon I took
him home, for I didn’t want him to worry.</p>

<p>“Well, after we got home, your grandmamma
called me into her chamber to do
something for her, and I left your papa looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
out of the nursery window at the passing. I
often left him alone with the door open, and
he played nicely by himself. It took me quite
a little time to do what your grandmamma
wanted of me, and when I went back to the
nursery, not a sign of your papa was to be seen.
I thought perhaps he had slipped down to the
kitchen, he was so fond of talking to Cook, so
I didn’t feel anxious about him; but when
I went down to the kitchen and found he
was not there, I can tell you I was pretty
well scared. I hunted through the house,
but not a soul had seen him. The parlor
girl said she had heard the front door open
a little while before, but she didn’t notice
who went out.</p>

<p>“All at once I thought of those children
looking in at the candy store, that your
father had felt so sorry for. So off I started
for it, and I can tell you it didn’t take me
very long to get there. Well, what do you
think I saw?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Sam, breathlessly;
“what was it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, there stood your papa without any
hat or coat on, and with his little bank under
one arm. He had unlocked it, and he was
giving out the nickels to the children just as
fast as he could take them out, bless his warm
little heart! I never saw such a sight of
children as there were about him; where
they could come from in such a little time
was a mystery; but there they were, crowding
around him, and as fast as one got a
nickel, off he would run, and I don’t doubt
sent others back too.</p>

<p>“I can see your papa now just as plain as if
it was yesterday. There he stood in his little
black velvet suit, with his hair blowing every
which way, and his eyes shining like stars, he
was so happy.</p>

<p>“He didn’t seem at all surprised to see
me, and called out, just as happy, ‘They
can have Christmas presents now, Mary.
They have all got some money, and they can
buy just what they’ve a mind to.’</p>

<p>“‘What in the world shall I do without
my gold watch and chain, and all the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
nice presents you were going to give me?’
I says.</p>

<p>“He looks rather crestfallen for a minute,
as if that side of the question hadn’t occurred
to him before; then he says brightly,—</p>

<p>“‘You won’t mind waiting till next Christmas,
will you, Mary? Papa will give me
some money to buy something for you with,
and these poor little children didn’t have
any money at all.’”</p>

<p>“What did Grandpapa and Grandmamma
say to him when he got home?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Oh, bless you, they didn’t mind. He
was a real chip off the old block. In their
family giving comes as easily as breathing.”</p>

<p>Other stories followed this one, and by
and by the sleigh came to take Sam home;
and Billy bade him good-bye without a single
homesick feeling. What little homeless child
<i>could</i> have failed to feel at home in such
surroundings?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="155" height="153" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &nbsp; FLOCK of pigeons were walking
about in front of the engine-house,
picking up the handful
of grain that one of the firemen
had thrown out to them. They
were not <i>all</i> walking about, to speak accurately,—one,
the little black and white lame
pigeon, was hopping, with one little pink foot
held closely against his warm feathers. Jack
the Scrapper, the large handsome dark-blue
pigeon with the rainbow neck, was darting
in and out among the flock, seizing upon the
largest grains, and pecking at every pigeon
who came in his way.</p>

<p>The pigeons always got out of the way
when they saw the Scrapper coming towards
them. Sometimes a bold young pigeon would
face him, and stand his ground for a while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
but he didn’t keep up his resistance very
long. The Scrapper was so much stronger
and bolder that he always got the better of
the others in the end, and was worse than
ever after these triumphs.</p>

<p>The nearest the Scrapper ever came to
defeat was when he was attacked by the six-months
white squab. The squab was large
and strong for his age, and as <i>good</i>-natured as
the Scrapper was <i>ill</i>-natured. He had long
borne the Scrapper’s bullying ways with an
ill grace, and once seeing the bully peck
sharply one of the mother pigeons who had
meekly brought up several broods in a most
judicious manner, the spirited squab could
contain himself no longer, and flew at the
bully with great fury. Young as the white
squab was, the Scrapper had to exert himself
to subdue him, and the valiant squab held
out to the last. Although conquered by
brute force, his spirit was as dauntless as
ever, and he vowed dire vengeance so soon
as he should have grown to his full strength.</p>

<p>The white squab had mild eyes and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
gentle disposition. He never picked a quarrel,
but never took an insult or saw the weak
abused if he could help it. These traits made
him very popular with the flock, and many
of the older pigeons, as they saw him growing
stronger and larger, foretold that Dick the
Scrapper would have to look out for himself
when the plucky squab should have attained
his growth. Meanwhile the squab himself said
nothing on the subject, but went on his way
good-naturedly, growing stronger every day
and pluming his feathers with great care.
He showed no fear of the Scrapper and
never got out of his way as the others did,
but it was noticed that the Scrapper never
tried to take the white squab’s food away,
nor ever pecked at him to make him get out
of his path. Perhaps he too saw how strong
and big the plucky squab was growing.</p>

<p>This day the flock of pigeons were feeding
in front of the engine-house, and the sparrows
soon joined them, hopping in and out among
the pigeons so adroitly that even the Scrapper
often found his food vanish from before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
very eyes just as he was on the eve of picking
it up. While they were thus engaged,
the two dogs, Jack and Boxer, came around
the corner of the engine house, each with a
bone in his mouth, and they lay down in the
sun in front of the engine-house to eat their
lunch in quiet.</p>

<p>The sparrows eyed the two dogs eagerly,
hoping that something would be left for
them, for sparrows like to pick a bone as
well as dogs do; and the pigeons walked
about, bobbing their pretty heads and cooing
to each other in low tones.</p>

<p>The two dogs were a long time at their
repast, for it takes time for a dog to crack a
bone and get at the marrow, which is the
sweetest morsel of all. Not a word passed
between them until the bones had been
cracked and the marrow eaten; then they
allowed the sparrows to approach and get
what morsels they could from the pieces left.</p>

<p>After they had both lapped their chops in
a genteel manner, they began to talk about
the matter that so interested the Fire-Dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now that the blind kid is so well looked
after, the next step is to find his mother.
Mr. Ledwell is trying to hunt her up, but it
takes time.”</p>

<p>“The humans go about those things in such
a round-about way,” said Boxer, who was in
an excellent humor after his savory lunch.
“If they knew enough to trust us a little
more, they would do better.”</p>

<p>“I believe that the woman is dead,” said
the Fire-Dog.</p>

<p>“No, she isn’t,” twittered a voice near
by, and one of the sparrows lighted in front
of the two dogs. “No, she isn’t dead, for
I’ve seen her, and know just where she is.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to find out so
much?” asked Jack. “It is more than likely
that it isn’t Billy’s mother at all. You never
saw her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have seen her,” twittered the
sparrow. “We were there when she fell
down on the sidewalk, and we waited around
until the ambulance came and took her away.
We flew after it, too, to see what was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
on, and we saw it stop before a big building,
and saw them take her out and carry her in.”</p>

<p>“Very likely she was dead,” said Jack.
“<i>You</i> couldn’t tell that, or she may have
died since.”</p>

<p>“No, she wasn’t dead. I could tell by
the way they carried her. I know she hasn’t
died since, because I’ve seen her since
through the window. I light on a big tree
that grows in front of the window, and I can
see just as plainly as if I were in the room.”</p>

<p>“It all sounds very well,” said business-like
Jack, “but for all that you may be
mistaken. It may have been some other
woman.”</p>

<p>“I am <i>not</i> mistaken,” chirped the sparrow.
“Here is a pigeon who has talked with her,
and he can tell you more about her than I
can. I don’t believe in trusting people too
far, so I keep out of reach, but this speckled
pigeon can tell you more about her than I
can. Come on, Pepper and Salt, and tell
Jack the Fire-Dog what you know about the
blind kid’s mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The black and white pigeon hopped fearlessly
up to the two dogs, and modestly began
his story:—</p>

<p>“You see, I can go ‘most anywhere because
I’m lame and nobody would hurt a
lame pigeon.”</p>

<p>“Except Dick the Scrapper,” cooed a
young pigeon in tones too low to reach the
Scrapper himself.</p>

<p>“Our friend the sparrow here had told me
about the sick woman. He was pretty sure
it was the blind kid’s mother, but he didn’t
dare to go too near. (You know some people
don’t like to have sparrows around.) So I
agreed to light on the window-sill and try
to find out more. The sick woman has
begun to sit up now, and every day at about
noon she sits in an armchair close to the
window. She looks awfully sick yet. Well,
the nurse who takes care of her sprinkled
some crumbs on the window-sill, and when
I ate them she was ever so pleased. ‘I
believe he would let us touch him, he looks
so tame,’ she said one day; and the nurse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
said, ‘I don’t believe it, he’d fly off if you
put your hand out towards him.’ I didn’t,
though, and she was more pleased still when
I hopped in and let her stroke my feathers.
‘Poor little thing, he’s lame!’ she said
when she saw my crippled foot. ‘Oh, how
my poor little boy would love you! He
couldn’t <i>see</i> you, though, for he’s blind!’
and then she fell to crying and wondering
what had become of her poor blind boy.
The nurse tried to comfort her, and I did
my best to make her understand that the
blind kid was all right; but she didn’t take
in what I said. I go to see her every day,
and rack my brains to think of some way of
bringing them together. I’ve tried to make
Reordan follow me, but he hadn’t sense
enough to know what I wanted. So what
can we do about it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that I know of,” replied Jack.
“So long as humans can’t understand our
language so well as we understand theirs,
they will be greatly hampered. It is a great
misfortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The bull-dog Boxer had listened with much
interest to the stories of the sparrow and
the pigeon, occasionally licking his chops or
shivering slightly,—signs that he was deeply
moved. As the Fire-Dog finished his remark,
he growled out,—</p>

<p>“Force them to it! That’s the only
way!”</p>

<p>“But how?” asked the Fire-Dog. “That’s
easier said than done. How would you propose
going to work?”</p>

<p>“Seize them by the trouser’s leg and <i>make</i>
them follow you.”</p>

<p>“And be taken for a mad dog,” remarked
Jack.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t care what they took me for,”
replied Boxer, “so long as I carried my point.
If I once got a good grip, they’d follow.”</p>

<p>“Unless the trousers gave way,” remarked
the Fire-Dog. “I’d bet on your grip, Boxer.
But, after all, that wouldn’t work, you know.
We’ve got to wait until the humans find out
about it in their own slow way.”</p>

<p>A country wagon came by just then, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
away fluttered the pigeons and sparrows.
Under the wagon trotted the large farm-dog
who had told the Fire-Dog about Toby.</p>

<p>“Any news of Toby?” he called out when
he caught sight of the Fire-Dog.</p>

<p>“Not much. I know where he is, though.
I’ve seen him.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so? Well, why doesn’t
he come home? He hasn’t gone back on
his old friends, has he? They say city life
is kind of enticing. I never had any desire
to try it myself.”</p>

<p>“He has fallen into kind hands,” replied
the Fire-Dog. “They are poor people, but
kind. I gave him your message, and he said
he meant to escape the first chance that
offered. He may and then again he may
not. He struck me as kind of soft. Not
a great deal of spirit, I should say.”</p>

<p>“You struck it right,” replied the farm-dog.
“There isn’t a better-meaning dog
than Toby, but he isn’t very strong-minded.”</p>

<p>“From what I have heard about him, he
must be a perfect fool,” growled Boxer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you seen him?” inquired the farm-dog,
bristling at once, for dogs don’t like to
have their friends insulted.</p>

<p>“No, and I don’t want to,” growled Boxer.
“Hearing is bad enough, let alone seeing.”</p>

<p>“Will you be kind enough to make that
statement again?” asked the farm-dog, marching
up to the bull-dog with his legs and tail
very stiff, and a ridge of hair standing up
straight on his back.</p>

<p>“As many times as you like,” replied the
bull-dog, who had risen to his feet and had
begun to walk in a wide circle around the
farm-dog.</p>

<p>“Now look here,” said the Fire-Dog,
“fighting isn’t allowed on our premises. If
you want to fight, you must do it somewhere
else. For my part, I don’t see any occasion
for fighting. I’ve led such a busy life that
I haven’t had any time to waste in that way,
even if I had had the inclination for it.”</p>

<p>“This is a question of honor,” replied the
farm-dog, “and there is only one way for dogs
of spirit to settle it. Your friend there has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
insulted a friend of mine, and unless he takes
back his words we will fight it out.”</p>

<p>“Take back my words?” growled Boxer.
“What do you take me for?”</p>

<p>At this point a sudden and unexpected
interruption came. The gong in the engine-house
struck sharply. The three grays came
rushing out of their stalls, and took their
places in front of the engine. The harness
was let down from the pulleys that held it,
and fastened into place. The fire under the
boiler was lighted, the driver was in his seat,
the men on the engine, and with a clatter of
hoofs out they dashed, Jack barking his
maddest and bounding ahead in such excitement
that all other thoughts were driven out
of his head.</p>

<p>As for the two dogs who a moment before
were ready to engage in mortal combat, they
were so engrossed by the sudden interruption
and the excitement, that for the time everything
else was forgotten. To the farm-dog
this was a novel sight, different from the way
they did things in his quiet town, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
a particle of the scene escaped him. The
bull-dog, with his natural pertinacity, was the
first to return to the subject of their late
quarrel; but the farm-dog’s owner, who had
missed him, came back to hunt him up, and
led him off, much to his disappointment and
the bull-dog’s also.</p>

<p>“Wait till the next time!” he snarled as
he was led away.</p>

<p>“You’ll find me on hand!” growled
Boxer.</p>

<p>Boxer was not usually so ill-natured as he
appeared in this episode, but it is true that
he was of a peppery disposition, and not
averse to picking a quarrel. He would have
given anything to have been a fire-dog like
Jack, and his disposition had become rather
soured in consequence. He was a steadfast
friend, on the whole, and would have given
his life, if necessary, for his old friend Jack,
whose good disposition made him beloved
of all.</p>

<p>So Boxer departed for home, thinking hard
all the way, for he was a conscientious dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in spite of his pugnacious temper, and,
although he would not have acknowledged
it, he secretly wished that he had not been
so disagreeable to the farm-dog.</p>

<p>“What is the reason,” said Boxer to himself,
“that when I so much desire friends,
I do the very thing to turn them against me?
I suppose it is because I was born so and
can’t help it.”</p>

<p>If the farm-dog had seen the bull-dog on
his return, playing with his master’s little
children, he would never have recognized
him as the same dog. They rolled over
together on the floor, and no lap-dog could
have been gentler or more considerate than
the bull-dog with his massive jaws and grim
expression. Thus it is with bull-dogs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_w.jpg" width="154" height="155" alt="W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE must not forget Toby, the
little yellow dog with the
black, turned-up nose. We
left him comfortable and
happy in his new home. The
children grew fonder of him every day, and
their mother found him no trouble at all and
a cheerful companion when her children were
at school. He was a quiet little fellow, and
after the children had left for school and the
morning’s housework was done, the mother
would take up her sewing, while Toby would
seat himself near by where he could watch
her as she sewed. Whenever she looked up
and glanced toward him he would wag his
tail and smile in the way dogs smile. If she
spoke to him, how fast his tail would go, and
he would almost lose his balance on the chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
he wriggled so hard. The affectionate little
dog had not forgotten how kindly she had
received him the night the children brought
him into the house, and he felt very grateful
to her.</p>

<p>Then, when the children came home, what
a rejoicing there was! Little Toby always
heard their steps on the stairs before the
mother did. At the first sound he would
prick up his ears and move just the tip of his
tail, for he was not <i>quite</i> sure if the steps
he heard were really those of the children.
Then, as the steps came nearer and he felt a
little more certain, his tail moved a little
faster; and at last, when there was no longer
any doubt, his tail wagged as fast as he could
make it go, and he would run whining to
the door. How he did wriggle his little body
as he jumped on them and tried hard to tell
them how glad he was to see them!</p>

<p>Then Johnny, and usually the two girls
also, would take him out for a run before
supper. It was not like the runs he used to
have in the fields in his country home, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was very pleasant after being pent up in
those small rooms.</p>

<p>The most unpleasant part of this new life
was the fact that great care had to be taken
in order to keep him out of the way of the
father of the family, who did not like dogs.
Whenever the children heard their father’s
step on the stairs, they always caught Toby
up and whisked him into Johnny’s little dark
room, where he had to stay, as still as a
mouse, so long as the father was in the house.
This was easily enough done at night, but in
the daytime it was pretty hard for the active
little dog to stay quietly in the dark room
where there was not even a window to look
out of.</p>

<p>The father of the family, who didn’t like
dogs, was just the kind of man whom dogs
didn’t like any better than he did them.
Somehow or other he always found dogs to
be in his way. If a dog happened to be taking
a nap on the floor or on the sidewalk,
instead of stepping to one side so as not to
disturb him, he always growled, “It is strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
dogs always manage to lie just where they
are most in the way.” Or if a dog barked
to let people know somebody was coming, he
would exclaim, “What a nuisance that dog is
with his barking!” In fact, whatever a dog
does is considered to be the wrong thing by
such people, so it is no wonder that dogs are
not fond of them.</p>

<p>Toby had seen the father through a crack
of the door and had heard his voice, and he
understood just what kind of a man he was,
and that it would be safer for him to keep out
of his way.</p>

<p>Things went on in this way for almost a
week, Toby being always hustled out of sight
so soon as the father’s step was heard on the
stairs. At last, however, Toby forgot all
prudence and betrayed himself.</p>

<p>It was a clear, cold night, and Toby had
been taken out by Johnny for a run. The
air was so crisp and cold that it was just right
for a smart run, and the boy and dog returned
with sharp appetites for supper. Toby’s keen
little turned-up nose smelt the savory fumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of sausage long before they reached the top
story, and he knew that a portion of it would
be his—it would be mixed with bread and
moistened with hot water and perhaps a little
gravy, but Toby knew just how good it would
taste. His sense of smell had not deceived
him; as they entered the kitchen, there were
the sausages still sizzling on the stove and
smelling better even than they had at a
distance.</p>

<p>“You shall have your share when we are
through, little fellow,” said the mother in her
kind voice; and Toby knew she would keep
her promise, even if she went without any
herself.</p>

<p>The table was set, the sausages dished, and
the family seated around the table, while
Toby watched them with greedy eyes and
watering mouth. Suddenly the mother exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“There is Father coming! Run and put
the dog out of sight, Johnny; he mustn’t be
bothered by him.”</p>

<p>So Johnny caught Toby up in his arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and hustled him off into his dark room. He
couldn’t bear to leave the little fellow alone
in the dark; so he left the door just ajar, that a
crack of light might enter to comfort him.</p>

<p>Toby had heard the step and recognized
it long before the mother had, but he didn’t
want to leave those tempting sausages. They
didn’t come his way every day.</p>

<p>“Father is tired to-night,” said the mother
in a low tone to the children, “so you must
be very good and quiet.”</p>

<p>The children knew by experience that
when Father was tired he was always cross
and easily irritated. Mother was often tired,
too, but it did not make her cross, and the
children learned to keep out of the way as
much as possible when Father came home
“tired,” as he so often did.</p>

<p>There was never much conversation when
Father was “tired,” and Toby in his dark
hiding-place could hear the rattling of dishes
and could smell the delicious odor of the
sausages. Father had not been expected so
early, and Mother had bought a nice piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
steak for his supper, but there was not time
to cook it then, so the supply of sausages was
rather short. Each of the children, as was
their custom since Toby had been an inmate
of the family, saved a little piece for him;
but they were very fond of sausages, and
they did not have such luxuries very often,
so it really required no little sacrifice on their
part. As for Maysie, the piece she laid aside
for Toby grew smaller and smaller as she
made up her mind to take just one more
taste and then another. At last it dwindled
down to almost the size of a pea, and Maysie
said to herself,—</p>

<p>“It isn’t worth while to save such a little
piece, it won’t be even a taste;” so she ate
that too.</p>

<p>The mother, however, seeing how small a
portion the little dog was likely to receive,
ate very little of her portion.</p>

<p>At last the silence was broken by Maysie,
who could never keep still very long.</p>

<p>“There was a fire to-day right back of our
schoolhouse, mother,” she said, “and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
were ever and ever so many engines there,
and do you mind the big black and white
dog that came to our fire and found little
blind Billy? Well, he was there, too, and
I patted him and he was very kind to
me.”</p>

<p>“He probably belonged to one of the
engines,” replied Mother. “I have heard
that dogs sometimes do and that they go to
fires whenever the engine goes.”</p>

<p>“And a fine nuisance they must be, too!”
muttered Father. “The men must be fools to
stand it. They always manage to get in the
way when they are least wanted.”</p>

<p>Now Toby from the next room had heard
every word of the conversation. When
Maysie told about the black and white dog
that belonged to one of the fire-engines, Toby
at once recalled the dog answering to that
description whom he had seen lying in front
of the engine-house, and who had taken such
an interest in him. When he heard Father
speaking of him as a “nuisance,” it was too
much for Toby, and, forgetting that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
not to show himself, he darted through the
partly opened door, and boldly presenting
himself before the startled family, declared
that it was not true, that the black and white
engine-dog was <i>not</i> a nuisance, but a kind
and obliging fellow!</p>

<p>“Where in the world did that dog come
from?” demanded the father, angrily. “How
comes he to be snarling and growling around
here?”</p>

<p>Although Toby was doing his best to defend
the character of his friend and was quite
eloquent in dog language, it sounded to the
ears of the family like snarling and growling.</p>

<p>The children were too frightened to answer,
and Mother undertook to explain.</p>

<p>“It is a poor little lost dog the children
found,” she said. “He was half-starved and
cold, and I let them take him in. He is a
good little fellow and doesn’t do any harm.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t do any harm!” growled Father.
“It is no harm, is it, to eat us out of house
and home, I suppose? I don’t work hard to
feed lazy dogs, let me tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“He eats very little,” said Mother, as she
looked at poor Toby, who stood shivering
with fear as he heard the harsh tones of the
father of the family, and began to realize
how imprudent he had been. “The children
each save a little from their portions, and it
doesn’t cost any more to keep him.”</p>

<p>“Turn him out!” ordered Father. “Here,
you cur! you get out of this;” and as he
held the door open, out darted the little dog,
expecting to feel Father’s heavy boot as he
went through.</p>

<p>Downstairs rushed poor Toby, so frightened
it was a wonder he didn’t fall headlong
on his way. When he reached the street
and felt the cold night air, he stood still,
uncertain where to go. The cold air had
seemed very pleasant to him when he had
run races with Johnny, with the prospect of
a good supper and warm quarters before him;
but now what had he to look forward to?
Roaming about the streets all night, hungry
and cold, was very different. The wind was
sharp, and it blew through Toby’s thin hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
as he crouched on the steps of the tenement-house.
All at once he bethought him of the
old shed where he had been tied before the
children had taken him into the house. It
was cold and cheerless, but better than
nothing.</p>

<p>Toby groped his way to the shed, and
sought the farther corner where his bed had
been made before. As he approached, a
large rat started up. Toby could hear him
as he scurried away. There was a very little
of the straw left that the children had made
his bed of; probably the rats had carried the
rest off to make their beds.</p>

<p>Toby sat down and tried to think what he
had better do. He thought of the warm,
light kitchen from which he had been so
cruelly driven, and of the children crying to
see him sent out into the cold. He recalled,
too, the kind and patient face of the mother
of the family, and the many kindnesses he
had received at her hands.</p>

<p>“What a difference there is in people!”
murmured poor Toby to himself, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
thought of the kind reception he had met
from the mother, and then of the harsh voice
that had sent him out into the cold night.</p>

<p>“Well, crying won’t mend matters,” said
Toby to himself. “I’ll wait until daylight,
and then I’ll try my luck at finding my old
home.”</p>

<p>He crouched upon the thin layer of straw
which was all that protected him from the
cold floor of the shed. The bleak wind blew in
through the door, and forced its way through
the large cracks in the sides of the building,
and Toby grew colder and colder. To stay
there and perhaps freeze to death some cold
night was out of the question, and Toby
made up his mind that he would start out as
soon as daylight dawned, and try to find his
way to the kind engine-dog who had been so
good to him.</p>

<p>“If I were not so small that anybody could
easily pick me up and carry me off, I
shouldn’t care so much; but I’m so small
I shouldn’t stand much chance.”</p>

<p>By and by Toby’s quick ears caught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
sound of footsteps that he knew were coming
his way. “I thought she would hunt me
up,” said Toby to himself; “it is just like
her.”</p>

<p>The steps came nearer and nearer, and at
last, standing in the doorway of the shed, he
could see in the darkness the dim outlines of
the form of the children’s mother. “Doggy,
Doggy!” she called softly, “are you there?”</p>

<p>“Here I am!” answered Toby with a bark
of joy, and with a bound he was at her feet
and trying to jump up and lick her hands.</p>

<p>“I have brought you something to eat,
poor little fellow!” said the kind woman, as
she set a plate before him. It was the larger
part of her sausage that she had saved for
him, mixed with bread and potato, and it was
warm. How good it did taste to the hungry
little dog! and it put warmth into his half-frozen
little body, too.</p>

<p>The kind woman stayed for some time,
petting the little dog and telling him how
sorry she was for him; and Toby tried hard
in his dog’s way to say that she need not feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
so bad about it, and that he didn’t mind it
much, for he couldn’t bear to see her kind
heart so touched. She had brought a piece
of an old woollen shawl with her, and before
she left she wrapped him up in it and told
him she would bring him some dinner the
next day.</p>

<p>Then Toby was left alone once more, and
the wind blew in at the open door and through
the wide cracks, and the rats scurried by him;
but Toby didn’t mind all this so much as he
did before, because the warm food had put
warmth into his body and the kind words had
warmed his heart. He even fell asleep under
the old woollen shawl, and when he next
opened his eyes the first rays of daylight were
stealing in through the doorway.</p>

<p>Toby started up at once, for he had
intended to start even earlier than this. As
he passed to the street, he glanced up at the
home from which he had been driven. He
had hoped to catch a glimpse of one of the
children or of the mother, but instead of that
he heard on the stairs the heavy tread of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
father starting out to his work, and away
sped Toby without stopping to look behind
him.</p>

<p>Jack the Fire-Dog was right in his estimate
of Toby’s character. He was not a dog of
much strength of mind, and instead of hiding
out of sight until the man he so dreaded had
passed, and then quietly making up his mind
which way he should go, as a stronger-minded
dog would have done, he rushed blindly
along until he was out of breath. Then he
stopped and looked about him. Everything
was new and strange to him. What should
he do?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TENTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="146" height="149" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE more Toby tried to think
out a plan for action, the more
undecided he became, as is
always the way with weak
natures. The sun was now up,
and the great city was stirring with life.
Wagons from the outlying towns were coming
into the city, shops were being opened,
and sidewalks and front steps were being
washed and swept. But in the midst of all
this busy life not a soul had a thought for
the poor little lost dog. One boy, carrying
a can of milk, did stop to pat him, but he
had no time to waste, and passed on.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do? What <i>shall</i> I do?”
moaned Toby, helplessly. “Such a big, big
world, and no place for me!”</p>

<p>At the corner of a distant street he saw
a group of dogs, all larger than he was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
They seemed, by the sound of their voices,
to be quarrelling, and Toby did not dare
venture near them. He knew by experience
that when dogs are in a quarrelsome state of
mind they are on the lookout for some object
upon which to vent their excitement, and it
was more than likely that they would turn
the current of this excitement upon him, a
stranger in the city. City dogs, too, as a
general thing, do not like dogs from the
country.</p>

<p>While Toby looked, the voices grew louder
and more angry, and Toby knew that the
next move would be a general scrimmage, in
which each dog would blindly fight with the
one nearest him, or, what was worse still,
all of them would attack one of the number.
It is only the meanest kind of dogs who do
that, but tramp-street dogs are apt to do it.
“What if they should all fall upon me?”
said timid little Toby; and without stopping
to see more, off he set at full speed.</p>

<p>The streets were now broader, and there
were dwelling-houses everywhere, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
shops. Gradually the city was growing
farther and farther away, and before long
fields and groups of trees were seen. Toby
turned into a broad avenue, and suddenly
found himself in the country. Broad fields
lay around him, and just beyond appeared
forest trees. A pond, now frozen over, stood
in one of the fields, and on it were groups
of happy children skating or playing games.
Toby had never heard of a park, and he
wondered to see the roads so level and everything
so trim and neat. He stopped to rest
and watch the children on the ice. Soon
the attention of the children was attracted
to him.</p>

<p>Toby was fond of children, and when he
saw a little boy coming towards him he began
to wag his tail in greeting. Then he
jumped upon him and tried to express his
pleasure at meeting anybody who had a kind
word for him.</p>

<p>“Poor little fellow!” said the boy, stooping
to pat the lost dog. “I am afraid you
are lost, and I think I had better take you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to the Home.” As he spoke, he took a leash
from his pocket and was about to fasten it to
Toby’s collar, when away darted Toby as fast
as his legs could carry him.</p>

<p>“The foolish little dog!” exclaimed the
boy, as he rolled up his leash and put it back
in his pocket. “I could have found a nice
home for you if you hadn’t been so silly.”</p>

<p>Toby did not know that this boy had saved
the lives of many stray dogs by taking them
to the Home provided for those unfortunates.
He always carried a leash in his pocket for
that purpose, and his bright young eyes were
very quick to detect a stray dog.</p>

<p>All that Toby knew about these public
homes was what he had seen and heard of
the poorhouse in his native town. He had
seen old men and women sitting out on the
benches under the trees in the summer time,
and he had seen their faces looking out of
the windows in the winter time. They
looked to him very listless and forlorn, but
he did not know what would have been the
fate of these aged people if they had not had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the shelter of this home. He had also heard
people say, “Why, I had rather go to the
poorhouse than do that,” and so he had come
to consider that going to such an institution
was about the worst thing that could happen
to anybody. A poorhouse for dogs Toby
thought must be a dreadful place, and he
resolved that he would rather roam the
streets at the risk of starving or freezing
than allow himself to be taken to one.</p>

<p>So Toby ran until he reached the woods
that he saw before him, and when he found
that the boy was not following him he slackened
his pace. Everything seemed very
quiet and peaceful about him. Occasionally
a crow cawed from one of the tall hemlocks,
the harsh voices of blue-jays reached
him from the clumps of neighboring trees,
and the squirrels, running along the branches
or jumping from tree to tree, chatted in a
friendly manner with one another. Sparrows
were there also, as happy and satisfied with
themselves as if their constant twittering
were melodious songs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Toby watched all these inhabitants of the
woods with great interest, for the country-bred
dog had often watched them, and he
knew their ways. It was soon evident to
Toby that these little creatures were expecting
something to take place, and something
of a pleasant nature, too, for they were all
in a happy mood. The sparrows flew backward
and forward, sometimes disappearing
for a while, but always turning up again as
cheerful as ever. A flock of pigeons also
appeared, and, alighting on the snow, some
walked about in search of any stray morsels
of food which might have been overlooked,
while others took advantage of this opportunity
to put their plumage in order.</p>

<p>Toby, curious to see what it could be that
these little creatures were expecting, secreted
himself behind a clump of barberry bushes
and waited. He thought his presence was
not noticed, but he was mistaken. The
bright little eyes of the nuthatch were on
him, and he was trying his best to find out
something about the stranger. Creeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
along the under side of a large limb that
grew near the spot where Toby sat hidden,
the bright eyes watched every motion, for
nuthatches are timid birds and very suspicious
of strangers.</p>

<p>All at once the sparrows who had disappeared
from sight came flying back in
great excitement, twittering as they flew:
“Coming! Coming! He is almost here!”
and immediately secured favorable positions
on the outskirts of the party.</p>

<p>No sooner had the sparrows settled themselves,
than a sleigh drawn by two handsome
horses was seen approaching at a rapid rate.
In the sleigh were two little boys and a
middle-aged gentleman. One of the boys
sprang out as soon as the sleigh stopped, and
Toby noticed that he had a basket in his
hand. The other boy sat still until the
gentleman alighted and lifted him carefully
out.</p>

<p>“Here they are, Billy!” exclaimed the
little boy who had jumped out. “They are
all here, and Dick the Scrapper is here too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
just as cross as ever. Oh, you ought to see
how handsome the squirrels look!”</p>

<p>“Can’t he see for himself, without that
smart little chap telling him?” muttered
Toby to himself.</p>

<p>“No, he can’t,” replied a voice from above.
“Don’t you see that he is not a seeing
child?”</p>

<p>Toby started, to find that he had been
overheard, and looking up saw the little
nuthatch hanging head downward, eying
him sharply.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were there,” murmured
Toby, taken greatly by surprise.</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t. I’ve been watching
you for some time, and I can see that you
are a lost dog.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sam was scattering the contents
of his basket far and wide, reserving
the finest of the nuts to tempt the squirrels
to eat from his hand. He did not forget the
little blind boy, and gave the largest share
to him to hold.</p>

<p>As Toby looked from the face of the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
boy who was lending his eyes to his blind
friend to the genial one of his grandpapa, he
began to be puzzled. “Where have I seen
those faces before?” he said to himself. “I
am sure I have seen them somewhere. I
know I have heard the gentleman’s voice,
too. You don’t hear such a pleasant one
every day;” and Toby shuddered as he recalled
the harsh tones of the father of the
family.</p>

<p>Suddenly the vision of three children and
a little dog looking longingly in at the tempting
display of a bake-shop rose before Toby’s
eyes, and he exclaimed aloud: “I have it!
That is the gentleman who gave the cakes
to little Maysie! and how good they did
taste!”</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a dog bark!” cried
the little boy who had brought the basket.
“Didn’t you hear him, Grandpa?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the gentleman, “and it
came from behind those bushes.”</p>

<p>Sam ran around the clump of barberry
bushes, and there crouched Toby, trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
with excitement and anxiety. The kindly
expression in the little boy’s face, and the
pleasant tones of his voice, however, won the
confidence of the timid little dog, and he
made no resistance when Sam stooped and
took him up in his arms.</p>

<p>“He is a lost dog,” said Grandpapa, gently
stroking Toby’s head. “It will never do for
him to wander around in this bleak place.
We must look after him.”</p>

<p>“I will wrap him up in the fur robe, and
then he will be as warm as toast,” replied
Sam, carrying the little dog to the sleigh.
When he was placed in one corner of the
roomy sleigh, on the soft cushion, and the
warm fur robe securely tucked about him,
Toby was as comfortable as any dog could
hope to be.</p>

<p>Sam did not linger so long as usual this
morning, feeding the birds and squirrels.
Finding a stray dog was an unusual excitement
for him, and he was eager to look after
him. So he quickly emptied the contents
of his basket upon the snow, and the party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
started for home, leaving the crumbs and
nuts to be eaten at leisure.</p>

<p>Toby sat between the two boys, each having
an arm around him, and the sleigh started.
Toby had never had a sleigh-ride before, and
the rapid motion of the sleigh, with the jingling
of the bells quite excited him. He sat
up very straight, and pricked up his ears,
while his little black turned-up nose sniffed
the fresh cool air.</p>

<p>“I can keep him, can’t I, Grandpapa?”
asked Sam, hugging the little dog closely to
him; and Toby listened anxiously for the
answer.</p>

<p>“I am afraid Grandmamma would not like
the idea of having him around the house,”
replied Grandpapa. “A city house isn’t a
good place to keep a dog in.”</p>

<p>“But I could keep him tied up in the washroom.”
Toby looked anxiously from one to
the other, while his fate was being settled.</p>

<p>“Oh, he would be a very unhappy little
dog tied up by himself, Sam,” said Grandpapa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, he could play out in the back yard,
you know, and he could go to drive with
us,” pleaded Sam.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t be happy kept so, Sam. He
would feel like a little prisoner. I am sure
by his looks that he came from the country,
and he has probably had open fields to run
about in. I don’t believe he was ever kept
tied.”</p>

<p>“What can we do with him, then?” asked
Sam. “If he can’t tell us where his home is,
how can we take him back? I hope you
don’t mean to have the poor little fellow lost
again;” and Sam’s face grew as anxious as
Toby’s.</p>

<p>“Of course I mean to provide for him,
Sam,” said Grandpapa. “It is true we can’t
take him to his own home, as he isn’t able
to speak and tell us where it is, but we will
do the next best thing. We will take him
to the Home that receives all the stray dogs
and cats that are taken there. It is called
the ‘Animal Rescue League.’”</p>

<p>At these words Toby took alarm and gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a great bound to free himself. In another
instant he would have leapt from the sleigh,
but Sam was ready for him and tightened his
grasp on the foolish little fellow.</p>

<p>“Why, he tried to jump out of the sleigh,”
said Sam. “Do you suppose he heard what
you said, Grandpapa?”</p>

<p>“Dogs often seem to understand what is
said about them,” replied Grandpapa; “but
he would be very foolish to object to being
taken to such a pleasant place. He will have
the kindest care until a good home is found
for him.”</p>

<p>“Will they let him play?” asked Sam,
greatly interested, and continuing to keep a
strong hold upon the struggling Toby.</p>

<p>“Certainly they will, and he will find
other dogs there too. I don’t doubt he will
have a fine time.”</p>

<p>Foolish Toby kept up his struggles at
intervals, for he couldn’t bear the thought
of being taken to the Home. “A dog’s
poorhouse, that is what it is,” he said to
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder how they happened to think of
making a home for dogs that are lost,” said
Sam.</p>

<p>“I can tell you what I know about it,”
said Grandpapa. “A very tender-hearted
lady who loves dogs and cats, thought there
should be some place in the city where lost
and neglected animals could be sent. So she
went about to see people, and wrote letters
about it until she got people sufficiently
interested to give money towards it. Then
they hired a house in the middle of the city,
and all the stray dogs and cats people find
are taken there and kindly cared for.”</p>

<p>“That lady must be very kind,” said Sam,
thoughtfully. “I should like to see her.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will some day. They had a
Christmas-tree for the dogs and cats last
year, and I’m told they all had a fine
time.”</p>

<p>Sam burst out laughing, and Billy laughed
too, to think of a Christmas-tree for dogs and
cats.</p>

<p>“I suppose they put on it all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
things that dogs and cats like,” said Sam,
“bones and cakes and all such things.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they put on some things for them
to play with,” said Billy, who had listened
with great interest to all Mr. Ledwell had
said about the Home.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if they did,” said
Grandpapa.</p>

<p>“And I guess they put saucers of milk and
plates of nice food under the tree,” said Billy,
who had a good deal of imagination.</p>

<p>Toby listened to this conversation and
ceased to struggle. All this sounded very
well, if it were true, but he expected to find
at the Home dogs sitting about listlessly, just
as he had seen the old people at the poorhouse
in his town. The story of the Christmas-tree
pleased him greatly. “Perhaps,
after all, it is not so bad as I expected,” said
Toby to himself, as the sleigh stopped.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” said Grandpapa, as he
got out and took Toby in his arms.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look like a Home,” said poor
Toby to himself. He had expected to see a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
large brick building standing by itself like
the poorhouse. “It looks just like the
other houses.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, little fellow,” said Mr.
Ledwell, as he felt Toby tremble. “Nobody
is going to hurt you. You stay in the sleigh
with Billy, Sam. I will bring you both to
see the little dog when he feels at home.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ledwell entered the house and set the
little dog on the floor. Poor Toby was so
limp from fear that he could hardly stand,
but remained in the spot where he was
placed with drooping head and tail.</p>

<p>“I have brought you a new dog,” said Mr.
Ledwell, addressing a rosy-cheeked young
woman. “Have you a place for him?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t take up much room, that is
certain,” replied the young woman, stooping
to pat the frightened little creature. “Yes,
I guess we can manage it.”</p>

<p>At these words in rushed two little terriers,
and bouncing upon the limp and terrified
Toby, at once knocked him over in their
attempt to engage him in play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“You ought to be more polite to strangers,”
said the rosy-cheeked young woman, picking
up Toby and putting him on a chair out of
the reach of the two lively terriers, who
pretended that they had treed their game
and took short runs up to the chair, barking
themselves into a state of great excitement.</p>

<p>“We’ll give him something to eat, and
he’ll soon be all right,” said the pleasant
young woman.</p>

<p>The excitement of the terriers over the
new arrival had telegraphed the news throughout
the Home, and the deep voices of large
dogs and the high voices of smaller ones all
extended a welcome to the little wanderer.
Their tones told of kind treatment and comfort,
and Toby was comforted. “How different,”
he thought, “from a poorhouse! This
must be a good place!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER ELEVENTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_o.jpg" width="148" height="153" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the morning of the day before
Christmas Sam awoke
unusually early, and jumped
out of bed so soon as his eyes
were fully open.</p>

<p>“I must hurry as fast as I can,” he said to
Mary, “for I shall be awfully busy all day;”
and while he was dressing he talked about
the presents he was to give. “And the best
of all is the present I am going to have myself,”
he added. “I suppose you know what
that is.”</p>

<p>“Is it the little dog-cart for your pony it
is?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“No, indeed it is not!” exclaimed Sam,
contemptuously. “It is something ever and
ever so much better than that. Just think,
poor Billy is going to see, and I sha’n’t have
to lend him my eyes any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Won’t that be nice!” said Mary; but his
grandpapa from the door of his dressing-room
heard Sam’s words with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>“What shall we do about it?” he asked
Grandmamma when he had repeated their
little grandson’s words. “I think we ought
to explain about the operation that Billy
must undergo; but we have let him think
so long that Billy will see by Christmas he
will take it very hard. I thought the boy
would be all right by Christmas time, and
I wanted Sam to be spared the pain of
knowing what poor Billy would have to go
through.”</p>

<p>“I thought so, too,” replied Grandmamma,
“and I don’t like to disturb Sam’s innocent
faith. I don’t know how he will take it.”</p>

<p>At this point in burst Sam, full of excitement.</p>

<p>“I shall have to hustle around to get
through before night,” he said in his decided
way. “We shall have to start right after
breakfast to get the wreaths and things to
hang up, sha’n’t we, Grandmamma? And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
we mustn’t forget to bring some for Billy,
too, you know.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you rather spend the money
in something Billy could enjoy more?” asked
Grandmamma. “You know wreaths and
garlands are only to look at, and poor Billy
can’t see yet.”</p>

<p>“But he <i>will</i> see them to-morrow, don’t
you see?” said Sam, triumphantly. “You
forget, Grandmamma, about my Christmas
present, I guess.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” said Grandmamma, gently,
“don’t feel so sure about Billy’s seeing
exactly on Christmas Day. It may come a
little later, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it won’t!” replied Sam, decidedly.
“You will see, Grandmamma!” and he was
off before his grandmother could answer.</p>

<p>So soon as breakfast was over, during which
Sam was so excited that he ate very little,
the sleigh came around to the door, and Sam
and his grandmother started for the evergreens.
It was quite a long drive to the
big market, for they always bought them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
there, because the little boy enjoyed so much
seeing the large building arrayed in its
Christmas dress.</p>

<p>The streets, as they approached the business
part of the city, were crowded even at
that early hour. Everybody carried packages,
and every face seemed to have caught
the spirit of Christmas, which is a loving and
generous spirit. The shop windows were
gay with bright colors and garlands of evergreen,
and groups of people were collected
in front of the most attractive of these windows.
In one of them was a real Christmas
scene, and Sam wanted so much to look at
it that his grandmother told the driver to
stop. By standing up on the seat of the
sleigh, Sam got a splendid view. It was a
winter scene, with snow on the trees and on
the ground, and there was Santa Claus sitting
in his little sleigh, which was piled full of
presents, and four beautiful little reindeer
were harnessed to it. The crowd in front of
this window reached out to the street, and
on the outside, waiting to take advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
an opening to slip through and get a view
of the window, were three children, a boy
and two girls.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ledwell, who was always ready to see
just what was needed, caught sight of these
children who were waiting so patiently for
their turn to come. Seeing them look toward
the sleigh and at Sam, who was so intent in
watching the beautiful Santa Claus that he had
not noticed them, she saw that they looked
as if they recognized her little grandson.</p>

<p>“Say, Maysie,” said the boy, pulling his
little sister by the sleeve, “do you mind the
time when the gentleman gave us the nice
cakes?”</p>

<p>“Of course I does,” replied Maysie,
promptly.</p>

<p>“That is the same sleigh he was in, and
the same horses, and it is the same boy, for
I minded the fur cap of him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ledwell beckoned to the children to
come nearer. “Did you say you had seen
this little boy before?” she asked kindly.</p>

<p>“Yes, once,” replied Johnny, promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was the time the gentleman gave us
the cakes,” said Maysie, eagerly. “They
tasted awful good;” and Maysie almost
smacked her lips at the thought of them.</p>

<p>The elder sister gave Maysie’s dress a
little pull. “I’m not going to ask for any,”
replied Maysie, in a loud whisper, “so you
needn’t twitch my dress so hard.”</p>

<p>A smile came over Mrs. Ledwell’s face.
“Would you like to buy some cakes to-day?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Maysie, promptly, “but
I’d rather buy a doll.”</p>

<p>“Why, Maysie,” said her sister, reproachfully,
“I should think you’d be ashamed of
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t,” replied Maysie, without any
appearance of mortification. “She asked
me, so there!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I asked her,” said Mrs. Ledwell,
“and there is no harm in telling what she
wants most, for Santa Claus is about, you
know, at this time, and he has very sharp
ears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you suppose he heard what I said?”
asked Maysie, straining her neck to get a
glimpse of the Santa Claus in the window.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised if he did,” replied
Mrs. Ledwell. “You will find out to-morrow.
Now tell me where you live,
Maysie.”</p>

<p>Maysie rattled off the address in a loud
voice, for she hoped that Santa Claus would
overhear it and send the doll she wanted so
much.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ledwell then left Sam sitting in the
sleigh, and entered the store. She picked
out a beautiful doll, a pretty chatelaine bag,
and a boy’s sled, and ordered them to be
sent to the address Maysie had given her.
Then with a glow at her warm heart, to
think of the pleasure these gifts would carry
with them, she joined her little grandson.</p>

<p>“Do you remember to have seen those
children before, Sam?” she asked, as they
drove along.</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember them,” replied Sam.
“They were looking in at the cakes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
bake-shop window, and Grandpapa bought
them a great bagful of them. They looked
as if they didn’t have cakes every day,
Grandpapa said.”</p>

<p>Sam had taken no special notice of the dog
the little boy had with him on that occasion,
or he would probably have recognized the
lost dog he had found in the park as the
same one.</p>

<p>The market was soon reached, and Sam
and his grandmother went up the steps.
The front of the large building was piled
high with long garlands of evergreen for
trimming, and green wreaths bright with red
berries. Christmas-trees and branches of
holly filled every vacant nook. Here also
were groups of children, eager to obtain as
many glimpses as possible of the Christmas
pleasures they could not expect to have.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ledwell’s tender heart was touched
at the sight of the little patient faces, and
her ready hand went straight to her well-filled
purse. She knew by experience that
these little people would be there, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
provided a goodly supply of change. “Sam,”
she said to her little grandson, “would you
like to give those children something for
Christmas?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed I should, Grandmamma,”
replied the little boy, delightedly.</p>

<p>Each child seized the coin Sam held out to
him, and darted away with his prize with the
speed of the wind. Very few stopped to
express thanks for the gift, but the happy
faces spoke more eloquently than words
could have done.</p>

<p>“They remind me of chickens snatching
up a worm and running off that the others
may not take it away from them,” said Mrs.
Ledwell to herself, as she watched the little
waifs darting off with their presents.</p>

<p>“I just wish Grandpapa could have seen
how happy those little children looked to
think they could buy something for Christmas,”
said Sam, as he followed his grandmother
into the market.</p>

<p>“Oh, Grandpapa is feeling very happy
to-day,” she replied, “for he has been sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Christmas dinners to a great many little boys
and girls.”</p>

<p>“It <i>smells</i> just like Christmas here, doesn’t
it, Grandmamma?” said Sam, as they passed
down the long building, the stalls on both
sides tastefully decorated with evergreens
and bright berries.</p>

<p>“Now, Sam,” said Grandmamma, stopping
before one of the stalls, “we must pick out
a nice turkey for Mrs. Hanlon and Billy.”</p>

<p>“You must give me a very nice turkey,
Mr. Spear,” said Sam, trying to talk as
Grandpapa did.</p>

<p>“I’ll do the best I can for you,” replied
Mr. Spear; and after looking over a pile of
turkeys he selected a fine, plump one and
placed it before the little boy.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of that bird,” said
Sam, with a very decided air.</p>

<p>“Why, Sam,” said his grandmother, “what
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of those legs,” said
Sam in the same decided manner.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with them?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Mr. Spear, greatly amused at the little boy’s
grown-up air.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the color of them,” persisted
Sam.</p>

<p>“Why, what color do you expect them to
be?” asked Mr. Spear, trying to keep from
smiling. “I don’t know what other color
they could very well be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they could!” replied Sam,
shrewdly. “I want a turkey with yellow
legs, because they are the best.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I ever saw a turkey
with yellow legs,” replied Mr. Spear, gravely.
“If I had one, I would give it to you.”</p>

<p>“Why, Sam,” said Grandmamma, who had
been greatly amused at the conversation,
“what made you ask for a turkey with
yellow legs? They are always lead-color,
like this one.”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa always asks for <i>yellow</i>-legged
ones. He says the blue-legged ones are not
fit to eat,” replied Sam, “and you know that
Grandpapa is <i>very particular</i>.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s thinking of <i>chickens</i>,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Mr. Spear, “and has got ’em kind of mixed
up with turkeys in his mind.”</p>

<p>“That must be it,” replied Mrs. Ledwell.
“Well, I will have this one and another just
like it. You would like to send one to the
little children we saw looking at Santa Claus,
wouldn’t you, Sam?”</p>

<p>Then cranberries and apples and potatoes
were bought to go with the turkeys, and
some huge squashes took Sam’s fancy so
greatly that one was sent with each turkey.</p>

<p>After that, wreaths and garlands were
selected and piled upon the seat opposite
Sam and his grandmother, and they drove
home, the fragrance from the evergreens
mingling with the crisp air.</p>

<p>After lunch, came what Sam considered
about the best part of Christmas, the pleasant
task of distributing presents at the houses of
their friends. Sam liked to do this all by
himself, it gave him such a grown-up feeling.
So soon after lunch the sleigh was
brought around and piled high with packages
of every size and shape, each one neatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
addressed. Then Sam was tucked in on the
back seat all by himself, and he looked like a
little rosy Santa Claus, with his fur cap, the fur
robes, and the presents piled high about him.</p>

<p>Whenever they stopped to leave a present,
Sam would run up the steps and always leave
word that the present must not on any
account be seen until Christmas morning.
He left Billy’s and Mrs. Hanlon’s presents
until the last because he took the most
interest in them and wanted to make a call
on them, besides.</p>

<p>Sam found them both in the cosey parlor,
Mrs. Hanlon sewing and at the same time
telling stories to the little blind boy. Billy
had improved very much in appearance in
this new home. He was never left alone, as
he had to be so much of the time at the
engine-house, and his face lost much of the
sad expression it had before he came here.
Both Mrs. Hanlon and Billy were delighted
to see their little visitor, who came in with
his arms piled high with packages and his
face beaming with happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mustn’t either of you look into the
packages or try to find out what is in them,”
he said, as he laid them down on the sofa.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, we shouldn’t think of such a
thing,” Mrs. Hanlon assured him. “There
wouldn’t be any surprise for us if we knew
what we were going to have.”</p>

<p>Sam made quite a little call, and told Billy
about his visit to the big market and what he
saw there; and then he told him about the
three children he saw trying to look in at
the window where Santa Claus was. He
told him all about that wonderful Santa
Claus, too, how exactly like a real live man
he looked, about the four beautiful little
reindeer harnessed to his sleigh, and how
natural the snow and the trees looked.</p>

<p>Billy listened to all this with great interest,
and seemed to enjoy it as much as if he had
seen it as Sam had. When Sam told him
about the three children, and said that the
little one who wanted a doll so much was
called “Maysie,” Billy said,—</p>

<p>“Why, that was the name of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
children who were so good to me that time
they took my mother away.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was the same one,” said Sam.
Billy, however, could not tell how the little
girl looked, so they could not be sure.</p>

<p>“If I see them again,” said Sam, “I will
ask them if they are the same ones.”</p>

<p>When Sam thought it was time for him to
go, he repeated his instructions in regard to
the presents, and extracted a promise from
both not to exercise any undue curiosity to
find out what their presents were. When
Mrs. Hanlon followed him to the door, he
confided to her that his present to Billy was
a little fire-engine that would throw a real
stream of water, and he thought it would be
of great use, as they could water the plants
with it. “We can make believe there is a
fire and can turn the hose on just as real
engines do,” he added.</p>

<p>“It must be beautiful,” said Mrs. Hanlon,
“but I wish the poor child could <i>see</i> it;”
and she gave a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“But he <i>will</i>,” replied Sam, brightly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
“You haven’t forgotten what I told you
about my Christmas present, have you?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I remember; I only hope
you won’t be disappointed!”</p>

<p>“Of course it will come. It is sure to,”
replied Sam, confidently. “Didn’t my little
pony come all right?” And with a happy
good-bye Sam ran down the steps and jumped
into the sleigh.</p>

<p>“Dear little soul!” said Mrs. Hanlon, looking
after him as he waved his hand gayly at
her. “How disappointed he will be!” and
the tears stood in her kind eyes as she closed
the door and joined the little blind boy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWELFTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_w.jpg" width="154" height="155" alt="W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Sam went to bed that
night, he pulled his window-shades
to the very top of the
window, that he might awake
as early as possible. This
arrangement had the desired effect, for when
Mary came in he had examined all the presents
that were in his Christmas stocking and
was nearly dressed besides.</p>

<p>“I will tell you why I am in such a hurry,”
he said in answer to Mary’s look of surprise.
“I want to go over to see Billy the very first
thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must wait until after breakfast,”
said Mary. “It is a very cold morning, and
Billy is probably abed and fast asleep yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he isn’t,” said Sam. “He’ll be
sure to be up. So give me my coat and cap,
Mary, please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed, your grandmamma wouldn’t like
to have you go out so early,” said Mary, “and
such a beautiful breakfast as Cook has got!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about that, Mary,” replied
Sam, decidedly. “I <i>must</i> see Billy the very
first thing. I know the way very well.”</p>

<p>In vain Mary tried to persuade the little
boy to wait until after breakfast, but he was
so persistent she knew he would go alone if
she refused to go with him; so she very
reluctantly agreed to go. She dared not disturb
his grandparents at so early an hour,
or she would have appealed to them to decide
the matter. So the two started out on their
expedition.</p>

<p>Sam had never been in the streets at so
early an hour. The sun rises late at this
season of the year, and its bright rays were
just streaming over the tall house-tops as
Sam and Mary sallied forth. Most of the
families in the neighborhood were still in
bed, but the houses were being put in order
for the day. Front steps were being swept
down, front doors dusted, parlor shades drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
up, and sidewalks cleaned. Colonies of sparrows
perched among the trees and secreted
in the branches of the vines that grew against
the houses, had not yet finished their morning
hymns, and their joyous twittering was
heard on every side.</p>

<p>The air was so cold that Mary made her
little charge walk briskly, and by the time
they reached Mrs. Hanlon’s house his cheeks
were glowing. They found Billy dressed and
holding the engine in his lap. Sam gave a
keen glance at the little blind boy, who sat
passing his hands caressingly over the beautiful
toy, but his eyes were not bent upon
it,—they were fixed straight before him in
the same old way.</p>

<p>“Billy,” cried Sam earnestly, as he watched
the blind boy’s patient face, “can you see it
with your eyes?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Billy, cheerfully, “but I know
just how it looks because I can feel it, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you really see the pretty red
wheels and the shining brass and everything?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
said Sam, very earnestly. “Try
real hard, Billy, and perhaps you can.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Billy, gently, “but you can tell
me all about it, and we can play with it all
the same.”</p>

<p>A great change came over Sam. The
bright color left his cheeks, and his lips
began to quiver. Kindly Mrs. Hanlon knew
what was going on in the little boy’s mind,
and she tried to take him in her motherly
arms to comfort him; but he broke away
from her and ran downstairs and out of the
door. Mary followed him, but she found it
hard to keep pace with him as he rushed
at full speed along the streets. He paid no
heed to her entreaties to stop, and arrived
breathless at his grandpapa’s house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ledwell, who was about to go down
to breakfast, was startled to see her little
grandson appear in such a breathless and
excited state.</p>

<p>“Grandmamma,” he exclaimed, “I am
never going to pray to God again as long
as I live!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Sam!” exclaimed his astonished
grandmother, “what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Billy can’t see,” he answered, “and here
I have been praying and praying for all this
time; and Mary says there is a pony dog-cart
for me in the stable, and I didn’t want
it! I just wanted to have Billy see!” and
Sam threw himself upon the lounge and
burst into a violent fit of sobbing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ledwell hardly knew what to do, but
she did the best thing she could possibly have
done. She let the little boy expend the
violence of his grief, and then she seated
herself by him and gently stroked the hair
back from his hot forehead. When the
weeping grew less violent and she knew the
little boy could listen, she said,—</p>

<p>“You must remember, Sam, that there
are a great many little boys and girls all
over the world asking God for different
things, and he can’t answer all at once. It
takes a long time, you know, so you must be
patient and wait a little longer.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t ask for anything else,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sobbed Sam, “and he has gone and sent me
the dog-cart, after all; and I was <i>very particular</i>
to say that I didn’t want it.”</p>

<p>“By next summer, Sam, I am quite sure
that Billy can see, and think what fine drives
you and he can have together!”</p>

<p>“Summer is a long way off,” replied
Sam, “and I <i>did</i> so want Billy to see
<i>now!</i>”</p>

<p>“We can’t have things come about just
as we want them, my dear little boy,” said
Grandmamma.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t pray any more, just the same,”
said Sam, decidedly.</p>

<p>“Billy is in a comfortable home and has
found kind friends, and Grandpapa will soon
find out where his mother is; and then by and
by Billy will see, and then how happy he
will be! There are a great many little boys
worse off than Billy is, so if I were you I
would try to be patient.”</p>

<p>Sam was silent for a while, and his grandmother
knew that he was thinking the matter
over in his sensible mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose there must be an awful lot of
boys and girls asking God for all sorts of
things,” he said.</p>

<p>“Indeed, there are,” said Grandmamma,
“and just think how much happier Billy is
than he was when you first saw him!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sam in his old decided manner,
“I guess I had better keep on praying
a little while longer.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too, dear,” replied Grandmamma;
“and now we’ll go down to breakfast
and be as cheerful as we can, because
if we look unhappy we shall make everybody
about us so, and we want all to have a very
pleasant Christmas.”</p>

<p>So Sam, like the sensible, conscientious
little fellow he was, wiped his eyes very
carefully with his pocket-handkerchief and
assumed a cheerful smile,—very much the
kind of expression, his grandmother thought,
that people have when they are sitting for
a photograph and the artist tells them to
“look pleasant.” It was rather a forced
smile, to be sure, but before breakfast was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
half over, Grandpapa, under whose genial
influence nobody could be long unhappy, had
brought real smiles back to the little boy’s
face, and they were laughing and joking
together as if there were no such things as
unhappiness and suffering in all the world.</p>

<p>“Now I will tell you my plan,” said
Grandmamma, “and you can see how you
like it. I shall be busy this morning, for I
must call on my old ladies at the Home and
see if they are having a happy Christmas,
but I propose that you two take a nice sleigh-ride
and invite Billy to go with you. Then
you can bring him home for lunch, and in the
afternoon a few boys and girls are coming,
and you can play games together. How
does my plan strike you?”</p>

<p>“It strikes me very pleasantly,” replied
Grandpapa, “and will suit me exactly, for I
have to see a man who lives out of town and
shall be glad of the company of the youngsters.
What do you say, Sam?”</p>

<p>“I think it will be very nice,” replied Sam,
“and I guess Billy will think so too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Suppose we stop at the ‘Animal Rescue
League’ and see how our little dog is getting
on,” said Grandpapa.</p>

<p>“Can’t we take some cakes to him?”
asked Sam. “I don’t believe he knows it is
Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we will take cakes enough to go all
around,” said Grandpapa.</p>

<p>A little later, Sam and his grandpapa, with
a box full of cookies and sweet biscuits, called
for Billy. The little blind boy was delighted
at the prospect of such a happy day, and he
beamed with smiles as his faithful friend Sam
led him carefully down the steps to the
sleigh, while Mrs. Hanlon, looking just as
happy, watched them from the door.</p>

<p>“What have you in that package that you
take such care of?” asked Mr. Ledwell, who
observed that the little boy carried a package
in one hand.</p>

<p>“It is a Christmas present for Jack,” replied
Billy.</p>

<p>“Why, Grandpapa, we forgot all about
him!” exclaimed Sam. “Isn’t it too bad?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“We have cakes enough to spare him a
few,” replied Grandpapa.</p>

<p>“Of course, I couldn’t forget about Jack,”
said Billy, “because he saved my life, you
know.”</p>

<p>“The dear little soul has been worrying
about what to give Jack for a Christmas
present,” said Mrs. Hanlon. “He has saved
up some of the money you gave him for presents,
and I told him I thought Jack would
appreciate some nice bones more than anything
else. So what does he do but ask the
butcher to sell him some of the very nicest
bones he had, with plenty of meat on them.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think, Sam? When I
told him they were for Jack, he wouldn’t
take any money for them! He said he should
like to give something towards a present for
the Fire-Dog, because he is such a nice dog.”</p>

<p>“You see,” said Billy confidentially to
Sam, as they drove to the engine-house, “I
can make a present to Mrs. Hanlon now,
because the butcher wouldn’t let me pay
for Jack’s present. Do you suppose she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
would mind if it doesn’t come just exactly at
Christmas?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she would mind <i>very much</i>,”
replied Sam, who remembered that the
Christmas present he so much wanted did
not come on time.</p>

<p>“Will you go with me some day and buy
something for her, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Sam, “and we will pick
out something real nice!”</p>

<p>The Fire-Dog was at home and rejoiced to
see them, especially the little blind boy whose
life he had saved. He was much gratified
too, at the present Billy brought him. One
large bone was given him, which he at once
took in his mouth and walked off with to
eat by himself, a proud and happy dog. The
rest of the package was left in Reordan’s
charge to be given according to his judgment,
and a dessert from Sam’s box of cakes was
added.</p>

<p>There was not time to stop and watch Jack
enjoy his repast, as the boys would have
liked to do, so they had to leave before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
was half through. Jack was very hungry,
but he was such a polite dog that he never
forgot his good manners, and whenever the
boys spoke to him, wagged his tail and
smiled, to let them know how much he appreciated
the attention.</p>

<p>“You ought to see how he enjoys that
bone, Billy,” said Sam, as they drove off;
and Billy looked just as happy as if he had
seen it.</p>

<p>Such a barking as greeted them when they
entered the building of the Animal Rescue
League! All the dogs who were around
came running to see who it was and to find
out if another stray dog had been brought
in; and among them, barking his loudest,
was little Toby, as happy and as much at
home as any of them. He recognized his old
friends at once, and tried by every means a
dog knows, to express his gratitude.</p>

<p>“They act as if they know it is Christmas,”
said Sam.</p>

<p>“So they do,” said the man who had
charge of them, “and they are going to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
a Christmas-tree just like folks. They do
seem to know something is up, they and the
cats too. The cats are going around with
their tails straight up in the air, and they
play with one another just as if they had
lost their senses.”</p>

<p>“This little boy has brought some cakes
for the dogs,” said Mr. Ledwell; and Sam
presented his box.</p>

<p>“They will come in very handy when they
have the tree,” replied the man.</p>

<p>Then the visitors were taken over the
building and shown all the inmates, even to
some big dogs out in the yard. All looked
happy and contented, and showed the best
of care. Some kittens especially took the
children’s fancy, and Sam explained to Billy
how they looked when they were playing.
One was lying on his back, kicking,
clawing and biting a worsted ball he had to
play with, and another was running sideways
with his back arched and his tail fluffed out,
as if he were dreadfully frightened at something;
while another had pounced upon one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of them and made believe he was going to
eat him up. The mother of this lively family
was pretending to take a nap, but her
half-opened eyes and fond and happy purring
showed that she was enjoying the
romps of her darlings as much as they did
themselves.</p>

<p>It was hard for the children to leave this
entertaining place, and especially hard to
resist the affectionate entreaties of the dogs,
who were delighted to see visitors. They
had to go, however, for a long drive out of
town was before them, and they departed
after a while, all the dogs who could reach
the windows barking a joyous farewell as
they drove off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER THIRTEENTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_s.jpg" width="152" height="156" alt="S" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOMEHOW or other on Christmas
morning everything takes
on a festive, joyous tone. The
very sleigh-bells seem to ring
out more merrily than usual,
and the children’s voices in their play seem
more joyous than on other days. Even the
shy sparrows seem to grow bolder, and
twitter more loudly than usual. The dogs,
too, seem possessed of unusually gay spirits,
and bound through the streets as if they were
thinking of the good Christmas dinner that
awaits them.</p>

<p>The two little boys in the sleigh felt this
Christmas influence and partook of the prevailing
joyous spirit. We will leave them
for a time and return to some other acquaintances,—the
three children who had cared
for the lost Toby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Great was the grief of the children when
they saw the little dog turned out into the
cold, dark streets, but they did not dare to
express their feelings before their father.
Directly after supper they went to bed, and
the mother soon went in to their rooms to
comfort them. The two girls were nearly
heart-broken, but the mother reminded them
that the little dog would be likely to seek the
shed for shelter, and she promised to look
after him and give him a good supper.</p>

<p>“He wanted some of the sausages so
much,” sobbed Maysie, “and I ate up the
piece I was saving for him, and I am so
sorry!”</p>

<p>“He shall have some sausage, dear, so
don’t worry so about him. I will cover him
up with something warm, and in the morning
you can take him to the home for lost dogs.
They will find a good place for him, I am
sure, a much better one than we could give
him.”</p>

<p>This hopeful prospect comforted the little
girls, and from them the mother sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Johnny in his dark bedroom. He was lying
very still, and answered in a voice that he
tried to make sound as usual, but the mother
knew he was trying hard to make it cheerful.
As with a loving hand she put back the hair
from his forehead, she felt it hot, and as her
hand brushed against his cheeks she found
them moist, and she knew he had been crying,
although he tried so hard to conceal the fact.</p>

<p>“Don’t fret about the little dog, Johnny,”
said the kind mother. “He’ll be sure to go
to the shed where you kept him before, and
I’ll look after him.”</p>

<p>“It was so mean to send him out, and this
such a cold night, too!” exclaimed Johnny,
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Hush, dear!” said the gentle mother.
“You mustn’t forget that Father is tired and
things worry him. He didn’t mean to be
unkind.”</p>

<p>“It was awfully mean,” replied Johnny,
“and him such a little fellow, too!”</p>

<p>Then the mother told of her plan to send
the little dog to the refuge provided for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
homeless animals, and, as she drew the pleasant
picture of the home the little wanderer
would be sure to find, Johnny allowed himself
to be comforted as his sisters had been,
and, feeling that Mother would look after the
wandering dog, he forgot his anxieties and
fell asleep.</p>

<p>We have seen how the mother found the
forsaken dog and fed and warmed him, and
how he at last found shelter in the very
home to which they intended to carry
him.</p>

<p>The following morning when the children
hastened to the shed they found it empty,
and great was their grief. They searched
for him for days, of course without avail.
Oh, if they could have seen the little
creature in the happy home he had found!</p>

<p>On Christmas morning they were almost
wild with delight at the presents kind Mrs.
Ledwell had sent them. As for Maysie, she
could hardly believe that she was the owner
of such a beautiful doll, and she handled it
with great awe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“I really believe that Santa Claus heard
what I said!” exclaimed Maysie. “You
know the lady said he had very sharp ears.”</p>

<p>The big turkey, too, gave the children almost
as much pleasure, and they crowded around
the mother while she cleaned it, and singed
off the pin-feathers by holding it over a piece
of burning newspaper. They had to see it
safely stowed away in the oven, too; such a
large, handsome turkey had never come their
way before.</p>

<p>“Now you had better all go and take a
walk in the streets where the nice houses
are,” said Mother. “The windows will be
all trimmed up with wreaths and garlands,
and perhaps you will get a sight of some
Christmas-trees, for people often have them
Christmas Eve.”</p>

<p>The mother thought it as well to get the
children out of the way for a while, for she
did not have a Christmas dinner to cook
every day, and she wanted to do full justice
to all the good things sent them; and how
could she do this with three curious children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
following her about and getting under foot
at every step?</p>

<p>So the three started, Hannah wearing her
new chatelaine bag in a position in which
she decided it would show to the greatest
advantage, Johnny proudly drawing his new
sled after him, and Maysie with her doll
perched on her arm in a position to show off
her beautiful clothes and at the same time
take in the sights. The lost dog was not
forgotten, and at every step they were on
the lookout, hoping to catch a glimpse of
him at any moment.</p>

<p>Their way led by the engine-house, in
front of which lay the Fire-Dog, finishing
one of the large bones that the blind boy
had brought him for a Christmas present.
They stopped to pat him and to look at a
flock of pigeons feeding there. They watched
the large blue pigeon, Dick the Scrapper,
who walked in among them snapping up the
best morsels and pecking any of the pigeons
who came in his way. They noticed, too,
the handsome white squab, so strong and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
so mild-looking; but the one that pleased
them most of all was the lame black and
white pigeon. He was so tame that he ate
out of their hands and even allowed them to
stroke his feathers.</p>

<p>The lame pigeon soon began to act in a
very strange manner. He would fly a few
steps, and then look back at the children as
if he expected them to follow him. This he
did so many times the children were certain
this was what he wanted. So they followed,
and as soon as the little lame pigeon saw this
he flew off again, waiting for them to overtake
him. This was kept up until the children
found themselves in a part of the city
where they had never before been.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t go any farther,” said Hannah,
“or we shall be late for dinner, and Mother
will be anxious.”</p>

<p>“I am very hungry,” said Maysie, as
visions of the beautiful turkey roasting in
the oven rose before her mind, “and my
feet are very tired too.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be much farther,” said Johnny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
“and I am certain that the little pigeon
wants something. You just sit on my sled,
Maysie, and I’ll give you a ride.”</p>

<p>This plan was very agreeable to Maysie,
and she seated herself on the sled with her
doll in her lap, while her brother and sister
drew her over the snow.</p>

<p>They had not much farther to go. To
their surprise the lame pigeon turned in at
a driveway and flew toward a large brick
building enclosed by high walls.</p>

<p>“What can it mean?” said Hannah. Perhaps
the little lame pigeon didn’t mean anything,
after all.</p>

<p>But the little lame pigeon did mean something.
He had recognized the children as
the ones who took little Billy home when his
mother had fallen in the street, and he had
taken this means to induce them to follow
him and discover the sick woman at one of
the windows of the hospital. With a noisy
fluttering of his wings he flew up to one of
the windows and alighted on the sill. A
pale, sick-looking woman was seated in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
chair close to the window, and the children
saw a nurse come to the window and open
it. In hopped the little lame pigeon and
alighted on an arm of the sick woman’s
chair.</p>

<p>“Why, Johnny!” exclaimed Hannah.
“Do you mind the face of the sick woman
up there? It is blind Billy’s mother.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it is?” asked Johnny.
“You never saw her but the once.”</p>

<p>“I know that, but I minded her hair,
because it is just like Billy’s, so soft and
curly, and she looks just the way Billy’s
mother looked.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they brought her here because
it is a place where they put sick people,”
said Johnny, who was convinced by his
sister’s positive manner.</p>

<p>“Now, if we only knew where Billy is, it
would be all right,” said Hannah.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she has found him,” said Johnny.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she has, because she
would look happy, and just see the sad look
of her!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The sick woman did indeed present a forlorn
appearance, even the children’s young
eyes could detect that, as she sat with her
head laid against the back of the chair, stroking
the feathers of the little pigeon.</p>

<p>They stood looking up at the window for
some time, and gazing curiously at the large
building before them.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is full of sick people,” said
Johnny.</p>

<p>“I wonder if there are any little children
there!” said Hannah. “Do you suppose the
sick people know it is Christmas Day?”</p>

<p>This reminded Maysie of the Christmas
dinner cooking at home, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I am just as hungry as I can be, and
I know it is ever so long after dinner-time.”</p>

<p>The other two children now became aware
of the fact that they were hungry too, and,
fearing to be late to dinner, they set off on
a run toward home, with Maysie on the
sled. Before they had gone far, they heard
the jingle of sleigh-bells and the voices of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
children coming up behind them, and seeing
a large sleigh and pair of horses in the road,
they drew the sled to one side to allow it to
pass.</p>

<p>In the sleigh sat a gentleman and two
little boys. The children at once recognized
the pleasant face of the gentleman. He
was the one who had bought the cakes for
Maysie. It would have been strange if they
had not recognized him, for where was there
another such sweet-tempered, happy countenance,
and who else possessed such a pleasant,
genial voice? So intent were they in watching
the gentleman that they did not look at
the two boys who were with him until just
as the sleigh, which went slowly, was opposite
them, they caught a glimpse of the little
blind boy.</p>

<p>“Billy! Oh, Billy! Is that you?”
screamed the two elder children in one
breath.</p>

<p>“Stop!” called Mr. Ledwell to the driver,
and the sleigh stopped in front of the
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The blind boy had heard their voices, and
recognized them with the quick perception
that the blind possess. He turned quite
pale with excitement, and stood up in the
sleigh.</p>

<p>“Where are you?” he cried, feeling about
him with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said Hannah, coming close
to the sleigh. “The three of us are here.
Oh, Billy, we didn’t know what had become
of you and we were awfully sorry.”</p>

<p>“And your mother is over in that big
house yonder!” exclaimed Johnny, excitedly.
“We saw her sitting up at the window, and
she looks awful sick!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother! Mother!” screamed Billy,
struggling to free himself from the fur robe
in order to get out of the sleigh. “Please,
Mr. Ledwell, let me go to my mother! Oh,
what shall I do? What shall I do?” and
the poor child, feeling his utter helplessness,
sank back upon his seat and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Try to compose yourself, Billy,” said Mr.
Ledwell, kindly, “and we will find out all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
about it, and if your mother is really here
you shall be taken to her at once.”</p>

<p>He then questioned the children, who told
him about the lame pigeon who made them
follow him, and who flew up to a window of
the big house where they saw Billy’s mother.</p>

<p>“I am sure it was Billy’s mother,” said
Hannah, positively, “because I minded her
hair and the look of her face.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ledwell turned back, and going in to
the hospital made inquiries concerning the
sick woman the children had seen at the
window. They were not mistaken, and in
a few minutes Billy was in his mother’s
arms.</p>

<p>After the excitement of the meeting had
passed, Billy told his mother all that had
happened since the dreadful day when she
was taken away from him. He told of the
kind children who had given him all they
had to give, a shelter and what food they
could spare, and how Jack the Fire-Dog saved
his life. He told, too, about the kind-hearted
firemen and his life at the engine-house, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
about Sam and his grandpapa and the comfortable
home he now had.</p>

<p>The poor woman could not find words to
thank the kind gentleman who had done so
much for her blind son, and when she tried
to express her gratitude to him, he told her
the best way to do it was to get well as fast
as possible and come and live with her son.</p>

<p>“I am anxious to find work, so that I can
take care of him,” said the sick woman.
“As soon as I am well I am sure I can find
something to do.”</p>

<p>“The first thing to be done is to get
strong,” said Mr. Ledwell, “and then we
will think about working. I propose that as
soon as you are well enough you go to Billy,
where you can have the best of care. You
will improve much faster there than you can
here, surrounded by sickness and suffering.”</p>

<p>The patient was pronounced not able to
leave the hospital just then, but was promised
that she should go so soon as it was deemed
prudent.</p>

<p>So Billy took leave of his mother, happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
at the promise of a visit the next day. They
found Sam with the three children seated in
the sleigh, and the new sled tied to one of
the runners.</p>

<p>“I thought we had better take the children
home, because they were afraid they would
be late to their Christmas dinner,” Sam explained.
“Do you think they will crowd
you very much, Grandpapa? We will
squeeze as close together as we can, and
Maysie is almost a baby, you know.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind a little crowding on
Christmas Day,” said Grandpapa. “Here,
Baby, you can sit in my lap.”</p>

<p>“I am as big as Johnny,” replied Maysie,
who was ambitious to be considered big.</p>

<p>Sam looked just as happy as Billy, thinking
that the little blind boy had found his mother.
He sat silent for some time, and his grandpapa,
seeing his thoughtful, happy face,
said,—</p>

<p>“Well, Sam, what are you thinking about?”</p>

<p>“I am thinking how glad I am that Billy
has found his mother,” he replied, “and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
guess God thought He’d send this Christmas
present because He didn’t find time to send
the one I asked for.”</p>

<p>So Sam’s Christmas turned out to be a
much happier one than he had thought it was
going to be, and the three children who had
helped bring about this happy state of affairs
reached home just as the big turkey was
taken out of the oven.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOURTEENTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="154" height="152" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is some time since we have
heard from the engine-house,
and a change has taken place
since we last looked in. The
off horse was quite old, and the
headlong speed at which the horses were
obliged to go whenever an alarm was
sounded, began to tell heavily on him. He
was an ambitious fellow, and strained every
nerve to keep pace with his mates and do
his share of the work, but he was a tired
horse when the scene of the fire was reached,
and soon an order came for the off horse to
give up his place to a younger and stronger
one.</p>

<p>This order filled the kind hearts of the
company with sorrow, for old Jim was a
great favorite. When the news reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
them, there was silence for a while, then
warm-hearted Reordan burst out impetuously,—</p>

<p>“If old Jim goes, I go too. There isn’t
one of us that has done his work faithfuller
than old Jim has!”</p>

<p>“That’s so, he’s done his duty right slap
up. What would the others be without old
Jim, I’d like to know? They always take
their cue from him,” said another.</p>

<p>“I’ve always made it as easy as I could
for old Jim,” said the driver, “and have
done my best to make the other two do their
share of the work; but the knowing old
fellow won’t have it, and isn’t satisfied unless
his nose is just a grain ahead of the
others, so he can feel he is doing his share
and a little more.”</p>

<p>“He’s acted just like a Christian,” said
another, “and if we do our duty as well as
old Jim has done his, we sha’n’t have anything
to answer for.”</p>

<p>“Get rid of him!” exclaimed a young
man. “A nice return to make for his faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
service! It makes me sick to think how
horses are turned off when they begin to lose
their usefulness! Just think of old Jim sold
to some old junk pedler or such, and being
starved and beaten after all the good work
he has done! It wouldn’t break the Fire
Department to pension him, and they ought
to do it!”</p>

<p>“They <i>ought</i> to, but whether they <i>will</i> is
another thing,” said Reordan. “They will
say that they can’t afford to pension off all
the old horses in the department.”</p>

<p>“Well, if they can’t afford it, <i>we</i> can,”
replied the young man. “What do you say
to starting a fund for old Jim’s support,
and boarding him out for the rest of his
life?”</p>

<p>What could they say, but one thing, for
courage and generosity go hand in hand, and
to men who daily risk their lives to save
those of others, as do our brave firemen, a
dollar doesn’t look so big as it does to
smaller natures.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/i-212.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="two dogs looking at horse with some men standing around as well" />
</div>

<p>After this decision the hearts of all were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
lightened, but parting with their old friend
came hard.</p>

<p>“Let’s get him out of the way before the
new horse comes,” said Reordan. “It would
hurt his feelings to see a new horse in the
stall that has been his for so long.”</p>

<p>The others felt as Reordan did, and just
before the new horse arrived, old Jim came
out of his stall for the last time. The intelligent
creature turned his eyes on the men
gathered to bid him farewell, and rubbed his
nose affectionately against the shoulders of
those who stood nearest him.</p>

<p>“He knows he’s being sent off just as well
as we do,” said one, “and he’s trying to say
good-bye to us.”</p>

<p>He certainly did know it, for his large,
mild eyes had the sorrowful look that all
dumb creatures have at leaving old friends.</p>

<p>“He looks kind of reproachful,” said one,
“just as if he thought we hadn’t appreciated
the good work he’s done for us.”</p>

<p>The men had bought a warm blanket for
the old horse, knowing that he was going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
a country stable which was not so warm as
his stall in the engine-house. This was
buckled on him, and he was led away. At
the door he hesitated a moment, and looked
back at his old home; then, with drooping
head, he left for his new quarters.</p>

<p>“Be good to him,” said the captain to the
man who had come to take the old horse to
his new home. “The best you’ve got isn’t
any too good for old Jim.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take good care of him,” replied
the man. “You don’t need to worry about
him.”</p>

<p>They watched the old horse so long as he
was in sight, and nothing was said for some
time. Then Reordan spoke,—</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a comfort to think we’ve done
the best we could for the old horse. He’ll
have plenty to eat and a good place to sleep
in, and he will have as comfortable an old
age as we can give him.”</p>

<p>Jack the Fire-Dog had, of course, known
what was going on, and his heart was every
bit as sad as the men’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose I’m a fool to feel so bad about
it,” he confided to his friend Boxer, “but I
can’t help it. We’ve been to a good many
fires together, first and last, old Jim and I.
My turn will come next, I suppose. I’m
not so young as I once was, and old dogs are
in the way.”</p>

<p>Such remarks as these had a most depressing
effect upon his friend Boxer, for there is
no dog more attached to his friends and more
sympathetic than a bull-dog, although he is
so reserved that he does not find it easy to
express his feelings.</p>

<p>Boxer pondered over the situation, and the
more he thought about it the more convinced
he became that something <i>must</i> be done.
He was on hand when the old engine-horse
was taken away from the home that had been
his for so long, and, as he looked at his friend
Jack’s mournful face and heard him softly
crying to himself, Boxer could bear it no
longer.</p>

<p>“It is true that they will be sending him
away next,” he muttered to himself; and as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
indignation increased he cast his eyes about
for something upon which to vent his anger.
The man leading old Jim away caught his
attention, and without stopping to consider
the justice of his act, in true bull-dog fashion
he rushed after them and seized the man by
the leg of his trousers.</p>

<p>A commotion at once arose. Old Jim,
startled at the sudden attack, started back,
twitching the halter-rope out of the man’s
hand, while the man struggled to free his leg
from the bull-dog’s grip.</p>

<p>A bull-dog’s grip is a very peculiar thing.
When he becomes excited, his jaws, which
are very strong and formed differently from
those of other dogs, become tightly locked.
A spasm of the jaw seizes him, and it is
impossible for him to unlock them himself
until the spasm has passed. So Boxer held
on, with his eyes set and his feet braced.</p>

<p>Now that old Jim was free, he stood still
and looked on to see how the affair was coming
out. He was not the only spectator,
for quite a crowd collected at once. Varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
was the advice given to make the bull-dog
loose his grip, and poor Boxer would have
been roughly handled had not Reordan seen
the commotion and run to the spot. In a
twinkling he had out a sulphur match, and,
lighting it, held it as near the dog’s nose as
he could without burning it.</p>

<p>The suffocating fumes of the sulphur match
did their work, and Boxer gasped for breath.
Thus his jaws were unlocked, and the man
was freed. After such an excitement a dog
always feels weak and shaky, and Boxer returned
to his friend Jack with drooping tail
and unsteady legs.</p>

<p>“Well, I never before saw a bull-dog made
to quit his hold that way,” said one of the
on-lookers.</p>

<p>“It’s the best way,” replied Reordan.
“It’s a bull-dog’s nature to hold on when
once he gets started, and he doesn’t know
how to stop. There’s no use pounding him to
make him let go. He simply can’t do it till
the spasm in his jaw lets up, and I don’t know
any better way to bring it about than this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did he tackle me for, anyway?”
asked the man. “I didn’t do anything to
him, and the first thing I knew he grabbed
me by the leg.”</p>

<p>“He probably thought you didn’t have
any business to take the horse off. He hangs
round the engine-house a good deal;” and
Reordan stroked old Jim’s nose, for the old
horse had come up behind him and put his
head over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Well, if my trousers stood that, I guess
they’ll stand all the work I’ll give ’em for
quite a spell,” said the farmer good-naturedly,
as he took Jim’s halter and started for home.
“Say,” he added, as he saw Reordan’s eyes
resting sadly on old Jim, “don’t you worry
about the horse. I’ll look after him all
right.”</p>

<p>This assurance lightened Reordan’s heart,
and he returned to the engine-house feeling
that the best had been done for old Jim that
could be done.</p>

<p>The new off-horse arrived that day,—a
fine young gray, with all the restless life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that only a young creature possesses. He
was a superb fellow, and he knew it, judging
from the proud way in which he carried himself.
He was so full of life that he couldn’t
bring himself to walk sedately, but entered
the engine-house with a springy step that
showed his colt days were not far behind
him. When he was brought to a stand-still,
he pawed the floor in an impatient manner,
as if he demanded instant attention.</p>

<p>“Do they expect that colt to take the place
of old Jim?” asked one of the men.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll learn the whole business in a
short time,” replied the man who brought
him. “He’s very intelligent.”</p>

<p>“Well, if the department don’t mind laying
out their money in repairs, I don’t doubt
he’ll learn in time, but I don’t like the
look of his eye,” said the driver.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with his eye?”
demanded the man.</p>

<p>“It’s a skittish eye,” replied the driver,—“shows
too much of the white to suit me.”</p>

<p>“I’d be willing to pay for all the machines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
he smashes,” replied the man; but the driver
did not change his mind.</p>

<p>The new off-horse took possession of old
Jim’s stall as if it were his by right, and
made himself at home immediately. He was
very intelligent, it is true, and he learned his
duties very soon, but still his youth was
against him. He started off with the engine
as if the whole thing were great sport and
gotten up especially for his entertainment;
and if the other two horses had not kept him
back, there would have been a runaway engine
the very first time he was taken out.
He enjoyed <i>going</i> to a fire of all things, because
he could use his strong muscles and let
off some of the young life he didn’t know
what to do with, but he didn’t like coming
back. The other two horses were quite ready
to go home at a gentle trot, but not so the
new horse; and as they lumbered along he
felt that it devolved upon him to give a little
style to the team. He certainly did it, and
many turned to watch the fine knee action and
spirited bearing of the new engine-horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>One day his youthful spirits got the better
of the new horse. The department was
called out to a fire in the business section
of the city, and Engine 33 left the engine-house
in a mad rush at full speed, as usual.
When about half-way down the slope of
the hill, a man on a bicycle came suddenly
around the corner from a side street. The
new horse was taken by surprise and shied
badly. All the movements of such a powerful
young horse are vigorous, and the
engine was thrown against a lamp-post and
wrecked.</p>

<p>When the chief heard of the accident, he
remembered the dog who always ran in front
of the engine, and he at once said that the
dog was the cause of the accident and that
they must get rid of him. “It is enough to
make any horse shy to have a dog getting
under his feet,” he said.</p>

<p>It was in vain for the firemen to explain
that Jack had nothing whatever to do
with the accident; the chief refused to be
convinced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The order concerning Jack, however, was
not obeyed, for how could they part with
their old friend Jack?</p>

<p>The driver was right in his opinion of the
new horse. He certainly <i>was</i> skittish, and
before long a second accident came. This
time the order to get rid of Jack must be
obeyed, and the question arose what to do
with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Ledwell being the kind of man to
whom everybody in trouble appealed, Reordan
at once sought him and told him the story.
“We can’t have old Jack killed,” he said,
“because he is one of us!”</p>

<p>“Of course you can’t,” replied Mr. Ledwell,
“we must find a good home for him.”</p>

<p>“You see, sir, Jack has been in the business
so many years he wouldn’t feel at home
anywhere except in an engine-house, and if
we gave him to any other company the chief
would find it out, and ’twould be just as bad.
I don’t see what we can do. The poor fellow
would grieve himself to death if he wasn’t
in the Fire Department.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“And so he shall be,” replied Mr. Ledwell,
heartily. “There is an engine in the town
where I live in the summer, and I’ll write
and ask them to take Jack. They will be
sure to do it.”</p>

<p>Reordan’s face brightened. “It would be
very kind of you, sir, and just like you.
After Jack got used to it, he’d be sure to feel
at home, and the men couldn’t help liking
him.”</p>

<p>“Of course they will,” replied Mr. Ledwell,
“and we shall look after him too. Sam will
make it his special business to see that he is
well cared for.”</p>

<p>So Jack’s fate was settled, and, with a
heart even sadder at parting than were those
of the firemen, he was taken to his new home.
Boxer was quite desperate in his grief, and
wanted to make an assault on every one at
once and settle the matter in that way; but
gentle-hearted Jack accepted his fate with
the same fortitude that had led him to follow
through the thickest of the fire the fortunes
of the firemen he so loved.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JACK’S new home was in a sea-coast
town about an hour’s
journey by rail. A baggage
car does not afford much opportunity
for seeing the country.
Even if it did, Jack was not in a mood to
enjoy it, for if ever there were a homesick
dog, Jack was one. When the train stopped
at Seaport and Jack was released, the wind
was blowing fresh from the ocean, and the
sun was shining brightly.</p>

<p>When Nature does her best to make things
bright for us, we feel her cheery influence.
So it was with Jack, and he began to look
about him with some interest. The engine-house
which was to be Jack’s future home
was situated in the centre of the town. It
was a small wooden structure, very unlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the fine brick building where Jack had lived
so long. The men received him kindly and
with interest, for Mr. Ledwell had written
a glowing account of Jack’s sagacity and usefulness,
but Jack did not feel happy. How
could a dog of his years and experience be
expected to feel at home in a new place and
among new people?</p>

<p>Jack showed his gratitude in his dog’s way
for all the kindness shown him, but his occupation
was gone. He never ran with the
engine again, for he couldn’t go with his old
company. In vain the men tried to induce
him to follow. He resisted every invitation,
and watched the engine start for a fire with
perfect indifference.</p>

<p>“He is only homesick. He will be all right
when he gets used to us,” the men said; but
they were mistaken. The faithful dog, who
had stood by the company of Engine 33 so
long and valiantly, lost all his interest in the
Fire Department. When an alarm sounded,
he would sometimes start to his feet from
force of habit, but his interest went no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
further. He would sit and watch the engine
leave without manifesting the slightest
concern.</p>

<p>When this account of Jack reached the
ears of his old friends of Company 33, they
could hardly believe it, for they had supposed
that he would feel at home in an engine-house.
If he had been a young dog, he
probably would have adapted himself quickly
to the change, but the saying “You can’t
teach an old dog new tricks” is true in most
cases.</p>

<p>One day one of the engine men of the
town of Seaport went to the city, and, in
order to see what would come of it, took
Jack with him. As they neared the engine-house
which had been Jack’s home for so
many years, a change came over him as he
recognized familiar objects. His ears were
pricked, his tail no longer drooped, and he
hurried along at a rapid pace. When he
reached the engine-house, he turned in at
the entrance and ran upstairs as if he had
never been away. The day with his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
friends was a happy one, and Jack seemed
as contented and as much at home as of old.
The subject of his not caring to follow the
engine was talked over, and one of the men,
in order to try him, went below and sounded
the alarm. In an instant Jack was on his
way downstairs in the old way, and when
they saw his disappointment at the trick
played upon him, they were sorry for him,
for it made them understand how much the
Fire-Dog grieved for his old home.</p>

<p>After this visit Jack seemed more reconciled
to his new surroundings. He soon
made the acquaintance of all the children in
town, and endeared himself to them by his
gentle and affectionate ways. They began
to bring him the things dogs are known to
relish, as the children who lived near his old
home used to do. Surrounded by so much
kindness, no dog could have been unhappy,
and Jack gradually became accustomed to
his new life. It is true the excitement of
running with the engine was no longer his,
but other pleasures came into his life. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
long he became known to all the townspeople,
and they began to tell anecdotes of
his sagacity.</p>

<p>Mr. Ledwell, who felt a pity for the faithful
dog who was banished from his old home,
ordered the butcher in Seaport to furnish
the Fire-Dog with bones, and every morning
at the same hour Jack walked sedately to
the butcher’s shop and got his bone. So it
became a standing joke that old Jack had
an account at the butcher’s.</p>

<p>After his visit to the city, when Jack was
beginning to cultivate the social side of his
nature by making and receiving calls, which
he had little time to do in the busy life at
the city engine-house, he made the acquaintance
of a very affable young dog who greatly
pleased him. So much did he enjoy the
new friendship that he went to the greatest
length a dog can go in the way of friendship,—he
showed him the place where he buried
his bones and treated him to a generous
supply. The new acquaintance, however,
proved to be unworthy of the trust reposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in him, and went secretly to the spot and
helped himself.</p>

<p>When the Fire-Dog discovered that the
new friend had taken this mean advantage
of his generosity, he at once cut his acquaintance.
When they met, as they frequently did,
the Fire-Dog always looked straight ahead
as if he didn’t see him at all. This course
of behavior was very humiliating to the
culprit, and he felt the disgrace much more
than any other course Jack could have pursued,
for nothing humiliates a human being
or an animal so much as to be ignored.</p>

<p>Now that Jack was no longer a business
dog, it was astonishing how much time he
found in which to amuse himself. He had
in the old days, as we have seen, found no
time to indulge in the social pleasures in
which dogs take so much delight, such as
running the streets and calling on dog
friends. The only pleasures he then had
were the visits of the children who lived
near the engine-house, an occasional call
from Boxer, or a chance meeting with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
dog passing through the city. As we have
seen, he had not been popular with the dogs
of his neighborhood, on account of the jealousy
his important position excited in them.
Now that he had retired to private life, this
objection was removed, and the Fire-Dog’s
loving and amiable nature made him a host
of friends among his kind.</p>

<p>There were certain houses where Jack made
daily calls. He went with great regularity
to these houses, as if he felt the care of them
and must see that everything was going on
in a satisfactory manner. He always took
up his position on the door-steps or piazza
and waited patiently until some one invited
him to enter. If nobody happened to notice
that he was there, it seemed to make no
difference to Jack. He would wait a reasonable
time, and then take his leave, calling at
the next house on his list.</p>

<p>Still another pleasure fell to Jack’s lot.
He all at once took up the habit of going to
church, and every Sunday Jack was to be
seen at one of the churches in Seaport. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
slipped in quietly and took a modest position
in the back part of the church, where he
was in nobody’s way. He sat very still
through the service, usually taking short
naps during the sermon, but he was always
wide awake and attentive during the singing,
which apparently afforded him great enjoyment.
He went to one church after another,
as if testing them to see which suited his
taste the best, and finally settled upon the
Methodist, attending services with great
regularity. It was supposed to be the character
of the music which made Jack choose
this denomination, for the cheerful, hopeful
vein that pervades the Methodist hymns
seemed to be particularly acceptable to him.</p>

<p>This church-going habit was, of course, no
objection, as the intelligent dog made no
disturbance during service, and went and
came with the greatest propriety. Before
long, however, the children in the congregation
discovered that Jack was a regular attendant
at church, and from that time there
was a craning of necks to obtain a look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Fire-Dog, and whispered questions and other
signs which showed that the young members
of the congregation were more intent upon
watching Jack than they were upon the
service. When this state of affairs became
apparent, word was sent to the engine-house
that Jack must be kept at home on Sunday.
So the following Sunday Jack was locked up
in the engine-house, and a miserable morning
he passed, softly whining to himself when
he heard the church-bells summoning the
congregation.</p>

<p>The next Sunday morning when the firemen
looked for Jack to shut him up, the
Fire-Dog was nowhere to be found. In vain
they hunted and called; there was no response.
But Jack attended services that morning at
the Baptist Church. The following Saturday
night Jack was secured, and he passed the
next day locked up in the engine-house, a
very unhappy dog; and the firemen thought
they had at last found a way to keep the
Fire-Dog away from church, by securing him
on Saturday night. They were mistaken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
however, for the next Saturday night not a
trace was to be found of knowing Jack. The
next morning he slipped into the Universalist
Church as the swinging door was opened by
a tardy arrival, and he took up his old position
in the corner. He was one of the first to
pass out of the open doors when the service
was ended, and very few knew of his
presence.</p>

<p>After this, the firemen decided it was not
much use to attempt to keep Jack from
attending church, so they let matters take
their course; and as he went sometimes to
one and sometimes to another of the churches,
no further complaints were made. If he
succeeded in slipping in when some one was
entering, he took advantage of the chance
and entered; but if no such opportunity
offered, he seated himself outside where he
could hear the singing. When the congregation
came out, he joined them and walked
sedately home.</p>

<p>After Jack’s departure, his old friend
Boxer grieved for him long, and seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
take comfort in visiting the Fire-Dog’s old
home. He passed a great part of his time
there, watching the men and the horses, and
gradually came to be there most of the time.
He seemed to feel it his duty to guard the
property, and sat for hours in front of the
house, watching the pigeons and sparrows
when they came for the food that was regularly
thrown out to them.</p>

<p>Here Boxer’s duty ended. He was observed
to watch the engine start off to a fire
with great interest, bustling about while the
hurried preparations were going on, and
barking himself hoarse with excitement as
the horses dashed out of the engine-house
and disappeared down the hill. He watched
them with longing eyes, but could never be
induced to follow them, much as he seemed
to long to do it. The men concluded that
he considered this had been his friend Jack’s
privilege, and that he was too loyal to his old
friend to usurp his rights.</p>

<p>Boxer also took great pleasure in the visits
of the children who still came to the engine-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and they soon became very fond of
him, although at first the youngest among
them were rather afraid of his big mouth
and rather savage expression. Among his
visitors were Sam and Billy, and many choice
morsels of food he received from their hands.</p>

<p>So we see that although he did not take
the Fire-Dog’s place, he had a place of his
own in the hearts of the firemen and the
young visitors who came so often to the
engine-house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIXTEENTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_b.jpg" width="154" height="153" alt="B" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BILLY’S mother was soon well
enough to be taken to Mrs.
Hanlon’s pleasant home, and,
surrounded by the comforts
that kind woman knew so well
how to give, she improved rapidly in health
and spirits. The happiness of being once
more with her blind boy did more than anything
else to restore her lost health, for,
although but a short time had elapsed since
she awoke to consciousness after her severe
illness and learned that she was separated
from her boy, the anxiety and grief of her
loss had delayed her recovery.</p>

<p>Her eyes now followed his every movement
and change of expression, and again
and again Billy had to repeat the story of
his experiences. Sam continued to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
every day to visit his friend, and the gay
spirits and energy he brought with him
helped the sick woman on the road to health.
He often brought news of the Fire-Dog,
too, and of Boxer, who had established himself
at the engine-house. He told them also
about the pigeons, the sparrows, the lively
chickadees, and the other winter inhabitants
of the park, and Billy’s mother was just as
interested in them all as Billy himself was.</p>

<p>She could tell beautiful stories, too, of the
time when she was a little girl and lived on
a big farm. Sam never wearied of hearing
about the calves and sheep and the clumsy
oxen, who are so intelligent, although their
minds work so slowly. Billy’s mother, too,
knew how to draw pictures of all the animals
she told them about; and although Billy
couldn’t see them, Sam could, and it made
Billy very happy to know that his mother
could do something to give pleasure to the
little friend who had done so much for
him.</p>

<p>“If I only could <i>see</i>, I think I could draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
things,” Billy said one day, “because I know
just how they ought to go.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you could draw Jack?”
asked Sam.</p>

<p>“I think I could,” replied Billy, “because
my hands know how he looks.”</p>

<p>“Take a pencil and see how good a picture
you can make,” said his mother.</p>

<p>So Billy made a picture of the Fire-Dog,
as he thought he looked, and, considering
that he was blind and had never been taught
to use a pencil, he did very well.</p>

<p>“It looks just like Jack, all but the spots,”
said Sam, “but of course you couldn’t make
them because you couldn’t see them. I’ll
paint them in for you.”</p>

<p>After this, Billy began to make pictures
of the things he could pass his hands
over, and it helped many an hour to pass
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Soon came a time when the oculist whom
Mr. Ledwell had consulted about Billy’s eyes
decided that the boy’s health was now sufficiently
established to make it safe to operate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
So Billy was put to sleep and the operation
performed, but for many days afterwards he
had to be kept in a dark room. Without his
mother to sit by him and take care of him,
this would have been a trying time for Billy;
but with her by his side he was perfectly
contented to wait patiently for the time to
come when he should be like the seeing
children.</p>

<p>All this time Sam was not allowed to see
the blind boy, and the time seemed very long
to him. He had many boy playmates, but
not one of them was so dear to him as the
little blind boy to whom he had so patiently
loaned his eyes. He was persuaded at last
to try his new dog-cart, for by this time the
snow had disappeared, and his black pony
with the star on his forehead had been brought
in from the country. There was a new russet
harness, too, that became the pony beautifully,
and Sam was allowed to drive alone
in the park behind the big carriage, for the
pony was gentle and Sam a good driver.</p>

<p>At last came a day when Sam was told he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
could visit Billy, and he was in a state of
great excitement. “Do you suppose Billy
can see yet?” he asked his grandmamma.</p>

<p>“You must find out and tell me about it
when you come back,” replied Grandmamma;
and Sam thought she looked just as she always
did when she had a pleasant surprise for him.</p>

<p>So off Sam started, and he hurried along
at such a pace that Mary had to almost run
to keep up with him. As they approached
the house, there stood Billy at the parlor
window, looking out from among the plants.
As Sam approached, he noticed that the blind
boy did not stand still with the patient look
on his face and his eyes looking straight
ahead in the old way. His eyes followed
Sam’s movements with an eager expression,
as those look who are not quite sure they
recognize a friend. As Sam ran up the steps,
however, the blind boy’s face grew brighter,
as if he were now sure Sam was the one he
thought he was.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/i-240.jpg" width="335" height="500" alt="Billy in doorway talking to girl at window" />
</div>

<p>“Billy can see! Billy can see!” he exclaimed
excitedly. “I am sure he can,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Mary! Didn’t you see him look right at me
and kind of smile?” and he burst into the
house and into the parlor.</p>

<p>As Sam entered, Billy was standing in the
middle of the room quite pale from excitement,
but he didn’t say a word. He only
looked at Sam very earnestly, at his bright
eyes and rosy cheeks and his sturdy figure.
He always before seemed so glad to see Sam
and greeted him so affectionately that Sam
didn’t know what to think of the change in
Billy’s manner, which was shy, as if a strange
boy had come to see him.</p>

<p>“You can see now, can’t you, Billy?”
asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Billy.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you glad you can see?” asked
Sam; for he was disappointed to find that
Billy did not express more joy at seeing him,
when he himself was so glad for Billy.
“Didn’t you know me when you saw
me?”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps it was you, but I
wasn’t sure,” replied Billy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should think you’d be as glad as anything,
now that you can see,” said Sam.</p>

<p>Billy’s mother, who had seen the meeting
between the two children, thought it time to
explain matters to Sam.</p>

<p>“You see, Sam,” she said, “everything is
so new to Billy that he must become accustomed
to seeing.”</p>

<p>“He always used to know me just as soon
as I came,” replied Sam, “and now he acts
as if he didn’t know me at all.”</p>

<p>“He knew you by your step and your
voice,” replied Billy’s mother, “but he didn’t
know how you really looked before. His
mind made a picture of you, but it was so
different from the real <i>you</i> that he must get
used to the new one.”</p>

<p>Sam understood now why Billy had looked
at him as if he did not know him. “Of
course he didn’t know me, because he had
never <i>seen</i> me before,” he said. “I wonder
what sort of a looking fellow he thought I
was. What color did you think my eyes
were, Billy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know what seeing people call it,”
replied Billy.</p>

<p>“You see, he will have to learn the names
of the colors and a great many other things,
too,” explained Billy’s mother.</p>

<p>“I should think he would know them,”
said Sam. “Anne is only four years old,
and she has known them ever so long.”</p>

<p>“Your little sister can see, you know,”
said Billy’s mother.</p>

<p>“I suppose it makes a difference,” said
Sam. “He’ll soon learn, though, won’t
he?”</p>

<p>A new world was opened to Billy, and
there were a great many things besides the
names of colors for him to learn. Everything
about him seemed so wonderful! The beauty
about us, which those who are gifted with
sight take as a matter of course, filled this
newly awakened soul with wonder and admiration.
The blue sky and the trees, whose
buds were now bursting into their new life,
the birds, and the blossoming plants in the
parlor window, were a source of constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
delight to him. His greatest pleasure was
in drawing the objects that most pleased
him. These were so well done that Mr.
Ledwell gave him a box of paints, and the
boy was so happy in this new work it was
hard to get him to leave it long enough to
take the exercise he so much needed.</p>

<p>“I want to see Billy as sturdy as Sam,”
Mr. Ledwell said to his mother. “He must
go to school and play with other boys, or we
shall have a girl-boy, which we don’t want.
There is nothing that makes a boy so independent
as roughing it with other boys.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid they will ridicule him for
being different from them,” said Billy’s
mother. “You know he has been kept from
other children on account of his blindness.”</p>

<p>“I know it, and that is why he needs
the companionship of other boys,” said Mr.
Ledwell.</p>

<p>“But boys are so rough, and sometimes
they are unkind to sensitive boys like
Billy.”</p>

<p>“Boys are not unkind as a general thing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
they are only thoughtless. Billy will become
over-sensitive if you keep him tied to your
apron-strings. He will have to meet all
kinds of people, you know.”</p>

<p>So one morning Billy was sent to school
with Sam, who called for him. As Billy’s
mother, standing at the open door, watched
the two boys start off together, the contrast
between them was very marked, and she
felt that Mr. Ledwell’s advice was of the
very best. Billy, with the blue glasses that
he was obliged to wear when out of doors,
his blond hair falling in curly rings about his
delicate face, which was radiant with smiles
because he was at last going to a “seeing
school” like other boys, did indeed have the
air of a boy who has not mingled with other
boys.</p>

<p>Sam trudged along on the outside of the
sidewalk, his strong, sturdy figure in striking
contrast to Billy’s slender one. Billy’s mother
watched them so long as they were in sight.
Then she slowly entered the house, saying
to herself,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor boy, what a hard time he will have
before he gets to be like other boys!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the two boys went on, Sam
feeling very important to be entrusted with
the care of Billy, and chatting all the way
about his school-life. His grandmother had
sent Mary with him, fearing the two boys
would be careless in crossing the streets, but
Sam’s dignity was hurt at this precaution.</p>

<p>“I am not a baby, Mary, to have a nurse
tagging around after me,” he said, as soon as
he was out of sight of his grandmother’s
window, “so you can just go back again.”</p>

<p>This Mary did not dare do, as she had
directions to keep with the boys; so after a
serious conversation between her and her independent
charge, they compromised matters
in this way: Mary was to be allowed to
follow at a respectful distance on the opposite
sidewalk, provided she would not attempt to
speak to Sam or make any sign to show that
she had any connection with him. In this
way Mary could keep an eye on her two
charges and be on hand if her services were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
required. Sam threw occasional side glances
in Mary’s direction to see if she were keeping
the contract faithfully.</p>

<p>The two boys proceeded on their way for
some time, Sam using great caution in piloting
his friend across the streets, for Billy was
afraid of being run over by the teams and
carriages which were so constantly coming.
The city sights were so new to the poor
child, it was hard for him to calculate how
long it would take for the teams he saw
coming their way to reach them. This gave
him a timid, undecided air, and Sam would
often say when Billy stopped, fearing to
cross, “Come along, Billy, there’s plenty
of time to get over.” At this Billy would
gain courage and start, but he always reached
the other side before Sam did.</p>

<p>“Whatever you do, Billy, don’t ever stop
half-way across and run back again,” Sam
said, when Billy had been particularly nervous.
“If you do, you’ll be sure to be run
over, because the drivers don’t know what
you are going to do. It would be better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
to stand still and let them turn out for
you. They won’t run over you if you stand
still.” And Billy, who thought Sam knew
all about such things, promised to take his
advice.</p>

<p>At the next corner they met a group of
older boys on their way to school. They
were in the mood to find amusement in anything
that came their way, and as soon as
they caught sight of the two little boys, one
of their number called out, “Hullo, Blue
Glasses!”</p>

<p>The color came into Billy’s cheeks, and
Sam looked very defiant.</p>

<p>“Trying to be a girl? Look at his nice
curls! Ain’t they sweet?” said another.</p>

<p>“What’s your name, Sissy?” called the
largest of the group, a boy several years
older than the two little boys. At the same
time he took hold of Billy and made him
stop. “What’s your name, I say!”</p>

<p>The slight and sensitive Billy, tightly held
by the larger and stronger boy, was about
to reply meekly, when Sam called out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
“Don’t you tell him your name! It’s none
of his business what your name is!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t, is it! He shall tell me his
name and you shall tell me yours, too, and
tell it first;” and letting Billy go, he seized
Sam by the collar. “Come, out with it!
Now what is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s none of your business,” replied Sam,
stoutly, struggling to free himself from the
strong grasp of the boy.</p>

<p>“Come, let the little fellow alone,” said
one of his companions.</p>

<p>“He’s got to answer my question first.
Come, youngster, what’s your name?” and
he gave him a shake as he spoke.</p>

<p>“You let me alone!” cried Sam, who was
working himself into a very excited state,
and trying his best to free himself. “You
just wait until I get hold of you!”</p>

<p>Billy had been standing helplessly by,
wanting to assist Sam, but not knowing how
to do it. At last, when he saw his best
friend struggling in the grasp of the big
boy, he suddenly became desperate, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
throwing down his luncheon basket, flew at
the big boy and began hammering at his
back with his weak fists.</p>

<p>All this had taken place in a much shorter
time than it takes to relate it, and Mary, from
the other side of the street, had seen what
was going on, but she feared that Sam would
resent her interference, so she watched to
see that matters did not go too far. When
Billy made his sudden attack, she quickly
crossed over and released Sam from the big
boy’s grasp.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine business for a big fellow like
you to be after picking a quarrel with two
little fellows! Why don’t you take one of
your own size?”</p>

<p>The boy did really seem to be ashamed of
himself, particularly as his friends did not
uphold him, and he joined them in rather a
shamefaced manner. Sam, however, was
not satisfied with the settlement of the
quarrel, and made a rush after him, but
Mary caught him in time and held him
fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what <i>your</i> name is,” he
shouted, while he struggled to free himself
from Mary’s tight grasp. “It’s a mean old
bully! And you just wait till the next time
I get a chance, that’s all!”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame for little boys to be fighting
like the beasts that don’t know any better,”
said Mary. “What would your grandmamma
say if she came to hear of it? She would
think it was just awful!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Sam,
shrewdly.</p>

<p>Mary did not cross to the other side of the
street again, but kept with her charges, and,
until the schoolhouse was reached, improved
the time in lecturing the two boys on the sin
of fighting. Billy listened very meekly, and
even Sam received the lecture in silence; but
when Mary left them at the door, he said
very seriously,—</p>

<p>“Mary, I sha’n’t <i>begin</i> a fight, but if a
fellow hits me he’s got to look out!”</p>

<p>When Mary on her return related the
story to Sam’s grandmamma and grandpapa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and told how valiantly Billy had gone to
the rescue of his friend, Sam’s grandpapa
only smiled with his eyes and said, “He’ll
do!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVENTEENTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_b.jpg" width="154" height="153" alt="B" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BILLY’S mother was now so
well that she was eager to
begin work. “You have done
so much for us,” she said to
Mr. Ledwell, “that I cannot
accept any more.”</p>

<p>“Have you thought of anything special to
do?” asked Mr. Ledwell.</p>

<p>“I have thought a great deal about it,”
she replied, “and I should be glad of any
work that will support us. Since I have been
so long idle I have realized, as I never did
before, the fact that there are many children
thrown upon the charity of the world as my
boy was, but very few fall into such kind
hands as he did. There are institutions to
care for just such children, and if I could get
a situation in one of them I should put my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
whole heart into the work, remembering the
helpless position my boy was in. In caring
for other forsaken children I would work off
some of the deep sense of gratitude I feel.”</p>

<p>“It is a good scheme,” replied Mr. Ledwell,
“and we will try to find a place for
you. Feeling as you do, you are just the
one to look after the poor little waifs. It
takes time, though, to obtain such a position,
and meantime I can give you employment
in my business.”</p>

<p>So Billy’s mother began work at once, and
at the end of the first week was able to hand
to Mrs. Hanlon a sum for her own and
Billy’s board.</p>

<p>Billy gained in strength and health every
day, and soon was able to lay aside the blue
spectacles.</p>

<p>“I should think you would have your hair
cut just as short as it can be,” Sam one day
suggested to his friend. “You see, it curls
so that the fellows think it makes you look
like a girl.”</p>

<p>So Billy gave his mother no peace until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
his hair was cut so short that there was no
chance for it to form the curly rings to
which the other boys so much objected, and
Sam pronounced it a great improvement.</p>

<p>With the short hair Billy also acquired an
air of confidence which made him look more
like other boys, and he was no longer singled
out as a butt for their rough jokes. He
learned very fast, and his love for drawing
helped to make him popular; for on stormy
days, when the boys could not go out at
recess, it was a great pleasure to have Billy
draw pictures for them. His greatest pleasure
was to draw on the blackboard, and his
sketches, done with a bold, free hand, often
gave as much pleasure to the teacher as they
did to the pupils.</p>

<p>Before long came the time for Sam to go
with his grandparents to their country home.
Such good friends had the two boys become,
that a separation would have been very hard
for both. They were so unlike that each
had a good influence on the other. Sam,
full of spirit and health, would much rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
spend his time out of doors than in learning
his lessons, while Billy liked nothing better
than to sit indoors, working hard at his drawing,
or conscientiously studying his lessons,
that he might keep up with the other children
who had not been deprived of the use of
their eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Ledwell, who looked out so well for
every one, proposed to Billy’s mother that
she should live in a little house on his
grounds that had been built for his gardener’s
family. The present gardener, however, had
no family, and lived with the other men
employed on the place, and the house would
make a cosey, comfortable home for Billy and
his mother.</p>

<p>The latter by this time had obtained the
situation she so much desired,—which was
to look after homeless children. Her duty
was to take these little waifs to homes that
were willing to receive them, and to see that
the little ones were happy and well cared for
after being placed. This, of course, took
her away from home all through the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and she often returned tired from her day’s
work. Giving so much motherly care to the
neglected ones, who needed it so sadly, prevented
her from giving her own boy the care
he ought to have, and a pleasant way out of
the difficulty was found by having good Mrs.
Hanlon come down to the little cottage and
take care of it and of Billy. In this way Billy
was not neglected, and his mother could earn
money for their support.</p>

<p>It was a happy day for the two boys when
they alighted at the little station of Seaport.
It was quite a distance to Sam’s grandpapa’s
place, so they drove there in one of the
station carriages. Billy noticed how glad
all were to see Sam. Everybody seemed to
know him, and to have a pleasant word for
him, from the station master down to the
colored porter. Sam was just as glad to see
them, too, and asked after their families and
how they had been through the long, cold
winter.</p>

<p>It made Billy very happy to see how much
everybody loved Sam, and for every kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
word and look given to his friend he was
more gratified than if he had received them
himself. The grateful boy never forgot for
a moment how kindly and generously his
friend had received him when he was blind
and forsaken.</p>

<p>As they passed the different houses in the
village, Sam was kept busy in hailing old
acquaintances and hearing their cordial “Glad
to see you back again.”</p>

<p>They passed the engine-house, and there
on the sidewalk in front of it lay Jack the
Fire-Dog. Although he had never <i>seen</i> him
before, Billy knew him even before Sam’s
keen eyes discovered him. At the boys’ call
the dog pricked up his ears and gazed searchingly
at them; then, with all the power of his
eloquent eyes and wagging tail, he tried to
express his joy at meeting these old friends.</p>

<p>Of course the boys couldn’t go by without
stopping for a moment,—no human boys
could do that. So out they piled in a hurry,
and before the carriage had come to a stop
they were hugging and caressing their faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
friend. “Does he look anything as you
thought he did, Billy?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Yes, just, only a great deal handsomer.
Do you suppose he knows I am a seeing boy
now, Sam?” asked Billy, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if he did, because I
saw him looking at your eyes awful sharp the
first thing.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if he did, either,”
said one of the firemen who had witnessed
the meeting between the old friends. “He’s
awfully knowing.”</p>

<p>They could not stop so long as they would
have liked, however, because the driver of
the station carriage was in a hurry to get
back; so they had to leave the Fire-Dog.
“You shall come to see us every day,” Sam
called out, as the carriage started again, for
the dog’s wistful eyes said how sorry he was
to have them go; and the Fire-Dog did not
wait for a second invitation, but presented
himself about five minutes after the boys had
reached home.</p>

<p>“First of all, I must take you about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
show you everything on the place,” Sam said
to Billy. So off they started, the boys followed
closely by Jack, who seemed much
older than he had in the days when he used
to run with Engine 33.</p>

<p>First of all, there were the stables to be
visited, where in a paddock was the black
pony with the star on his forehead. He
came trotting up to the fence to see the boys
and rub his nose against them and beg for
sugar. They had no sugar to give him, but
a few handfuls of grass did just as well.
After he found they had no more for him,
he lay down and rolled over; then, after
shaking himself, he came for more grass.</p>

<p>These stables were wonderful places, and
had in them everything that boys, and most
girls, love. There was a new colt only a
few weeks old, but as tall as the black pony
with the star in his forehead, although his
legs were longer and not so prettily formed,
and he had a short, bushy tail. Clumsy as
he looked, however, he could run fast, for,
after looking anxiously at the boys for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
instant with his large, mild eyes, he darted
off at full speed to join his mother at the
other end of the field.</p>

<p>There was a litter of pups belonging to one
of the grooms, young bull-terrier pups, with
little fat, round bodies and very blunt, pink
noses; and the mother dog evidently thought
amiable Jack a fierce ogre, who wanted to
eat them up, for she flew at him with great
fury when he only wanted to admire them.
So she had to be shut up in the harness-room,
where she tore at the door and growled
and barked so long as the boys and Jack
stayed near her pups.</p>

<p>There were two little kittens, too, and
they also seemed to consider innocent Jack
a dangerous sort of fellow, for they arched
their backs and spit at him whenever he
happened to look their way.</p>

<p>When the stables had been explored, the
two boys and Jack ran down to the beach.
The tide was out, and they could walk far
out on the smooth sand. This was very
beautiful, but Sam’s favorite nook was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
little cove where the fiddler-crabs lived. He
was never tired of watching them at low
tide, and trying to find out whether each
had his own particular hole to hide in, or
whether they darted into the first one they
came to when surprised.</p>

<p>The two boys each singled out a crab and
tried to keep his eyes on him to watch his
movements, but they all looked so much
alike that it was very confusing, and after
an hour spent in this way Sam was no wiser
than he was before.</p>

<p>Then the shells that had been washed up
in the hard storms of the winter before,
how beautiful they were, and how exciting
it was to pick them out of the line of seaweed
in which they were entangled! Billy
had never dreamed of such pleasures, and
they were as good as new to Sam, now that
he had a companion to enjoy them with
him. Thus the two happy boys spent the
forenoon, while Jack wandered about the
beach, sniffing into holes and examining
the skeletons of the horse-shoes and crabs that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
had been thrown up by the winter storms.
They found many delicate skeletons of baby
horse-shoes, some not much larger than a
silver quarter of a dollar, and perfect in
shape.</p>

<p>“We must make a collection of curiosities,”
Billy said,—“shells and horse-shoes
and all such things.”</p>

<p>“I can show you where there are beautiful
stones,” said Sam. “I have got a little
bookcase where we can keep them, and we
can label them just as they do in the
Museum.”</p>

<p>As Sam spoke, the clear notes of a horn
were heard from the direction of the house.
“That’s for me,” said Sam. “They always
blow that horn when they want me, and I
guess it’s about time for lunch.”</p>

<p>So the two boys went toward the house,
carrying as many of their “curiosities” as
they could take, and Jack followed.</p>

<p>The fresh sea air had sharpened the appetites
of the boys, and of Jack, too, but they
spent as little time at the table as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
they were in such a hurry to go back to their
play on the beach.</p>

<p>In these pleasures the days passed so
rapidly that Sam’s birthday came around
before he had thought it was anywhere near
the time for it. Jack appeared every day
with great regularity, and never let them out
of his sight. Even while they were eating
their meals, he lay under the dining-room
windows, in order that he might be on hand
if they required his services.</p>

<p>“What should you like to do to celebrate
your birthday, Sam?” asked his grandpapa
one morning at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>“I know what I should <i>like</i> to do,” replied
Sam, who usually knew just what he wanted,
“but I don’t suppose there is any chance of
my doing it.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know those children who were
so good to Billy? The ones you gave the
cakes to, you know. Billy and I have been
thinking how much they would like to be
here and run on the beach and see the colt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and the puppies. Billy said if he had lots of
money he would just send for them to come
here and have a good time. It is awfully
hot in that part of the city where they
live, Billy says, and it smells awfully bad,
too.”</p>

<p>“I know it does, Sam,” replied Grandpapa,
very seriously, “and I wish we could take all
the children out of the hot city and let them
run about in the fields and on the beach as
you and Billy do.”</p>

<p>“I <i>knew</i> it couldn’t be done,” said Sam
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“We can’t take care of <i>all</i> the children in
the city, Sam,” replied Grandpapa, “but I
think we can manage to give these three a
taste of the country.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Grandpapa!” exclaimed Sam, and he
was so overcome with joy at the prospect
that he couldn’t find words to say how
happy he was. His grandmother was very
particular about his table manners, so he
said, “Please excuse me a minute, Grandmamma,”
and, jumping down from his chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
ran up to his grandfather and put his arms
about him and hugged him until his face was
quite red from the effort. “I think you are
the very kindest man I ever saw, Grandpapa,”
he said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHTEENTH</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="151" height="151" alt="M" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. LEDWELL was fully as kind
as his little grandson thought
him. That very day he went
to several of the townspeople
to ascertain if any of them were
willing to take three city children as boarders
for a few weeks. At last he found what he
wanted. A young married woman with no
children of her own was glad to oblige the
man who was such a favorite with everybody,
and at the same time earn a little
money; for money is scarce in the country,
where the means for earning it are so much
less than in the city.</p>

<p>On a beautiful morning about a week
later, the three children, beaming with happiness,
alighted at Seaport station, to find Sam
and Billy on the platform looking eagerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
for them. Yet when they met, the natural
shyness that children feel at meeting those
whom they seldom see, overcame the three
new-comers, and they found no words to express
the pleasure and gratitude that was in
their hearts, although their happy faces
spoke for them. Sam, always business-like,
was the first to speak and conduct them to
the wagonette which was to take them
to their boarding-place. When they were
seated in the wagonette, facing one another,
Maysie at last found voice,—</p>

<p>“Hallo, Billy!” she said, her face wreathed
in smiles.</p>

<p>They were all a little shy of Sam at first,
but they soon felt at their ease, for he
pointed out the objects of interest as they
drove along, and told them about the colt,
the puppies, the kittens, and the wonderful
things they would find on the beach.</p>

<p>“Is it hot in the city?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Just!” replied Johnny, briefly.</p>

<p>“I saw a horse that was killed entirely by
the hot sun,” said Maysie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“He wasn’t dead, Maysie,” said Johnny;
“it is just overcome he was. They took him
off in a big cart to the hospital.”</p>

<p>Soon the engine-house was passed, and
there sat Jack, who knew them as soon as
they came in sight. Sam insisted on taking
him in, and Jack, who seldom had the
pleasure of a drive, was very glad of the
opportunity.</p>

<p>“He looks like the dog I saw to the fire
that day I told you of,” said Maysie.</p>

<p>“It can’t be the same one,” replied Hannah,
“for that one runs with one of the city
engines, and he wouldn’t be so far from
home.”</p>

<p>“But it <i>is</i> the same,” said Billy; and
always glad to tell how faithful Jack saved
his life on the night of the fire, he told the
story to them, and how Jack happened to be
so far away from his old home.</p>

<p>When they stopped at the pretty farm-house
where the city children were to stay,
a pleasant-faced woman came out to meet
them and show them the rooms they were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
occupy, and Sam and Billy left them there,
promising to come for them in the afternoon,
to show them all the things they had told
them about.</p>

<p>The sweet air, the green fields, and the
singing birds were what these city children
had never before enjoyed, and nothing was
lost on them. There was only one drawback
to their perfect happiness, and that
was the fact that Mother was not there to
enjoy it with them.</p>

<p>“If Mother could only be here, too,” said
Hannah, “how beautiful it would be!”</p>

<p>“But she said she should enjoy it just as
much as we did, when we got home and told
her about it,” said Maysie.</p>

<p>“I know she said so,” replied Hannah,
“but it ain’t like smelling the beautiful air
and seeing the fields and things.”</p>

<p>“But she won’t have so much work to do
while we are away, and there won’t be no
noise nor nothing,” said Maysie, who always
took a hopeful view of things.</p>

<p>“The house will seem awful lonesome to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
her,” said Johnny, whom Hannah’s remark
had made a little homesick.</p>

<p>“She told us to have as good a time as we
could,” said Maysie, “and I’ve made up my
mind to see everything and tell her all about
it. Do you mind how pleased Mother is
when we tell her things we’ve seen?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Hannah with a sigh,
“but I wish Mother could be here all the
same.”</p>

<p>“But she <i>can’t</i>, you know,” said hopeful
Maysie, “so what’s the use of fretting about
what can’t be helped?”</p>

<p>“Maysie is right,” said Hannah, after a
moment’s silence, for she began to see into
what an unhappy mood they were drifting.
“The best thing we can do is to get as strong
and well as we can, and then we can help
Mother more when we get home.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” replied Johnny, once more
cheerful; “and it’s the pocketful of shells
and nice stones I’ll take home to her,—those
the boy told us of.”</p>

<p>“And the day we go home we’ll take her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
a big bunch of the flowers the fields is full
of,” said Hannah.</p>

<p>“And the kitten the boy promised me!”
said Maysie.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Father would let us keep
a kitten,” said Johnny. “You know about
the little dog!”</p>

<p>“Kittens isn’t dogs,” replied Maysie, confidently.
“I know he wouldn’t send a kitten
out on us.”</p>

<p>“I guess he wouldn’t mind a kitten,” said
Hannah, “because they keep the mice away.
I heard him tell Mother one day that she
ought to get a cat or the mice would eat us
out of house and home.”</p>

<p>So they agreed that it would be safe to
introduce a kitten into their home, and in
talking over the pleasant surprises they intended
to give Mother they were soon their
old cheerful selves.</p>

<p>Only those who have always lived in a city
can understand fully the state of bliss these
children lived in during their stay in the country.
Hunting for eggs in the hen-house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
barn, discovering stolen nests, going to the
pasture for the cows, and watching the process
of milking, riding to the hayfield in the
empty hay-rigging, and, after treading down
the load, making a deep nest in the hay and
riding back to the barn,—particularly enjoying
the jolt as the heavy wagon went over
the high threshold,—then the pleasure of
sliding down from the top of the high load into
the farmer’s arms!—that was the best of all.</p>

<p>In these simple country pleasures, in the
company of Sam and Billy, and the enjoyment
of Mr. Ledwell’s beautiful place, the days
flew rapidly by, leaving as they went traces
of the fresh air and sunlight on their blooming
cheeks and sun-browned skins. Almost
before they knew it, the time for which they
had been invited had passed, and their faces
grew long when they thought of leaving these
blissful scenes. The calves, the hens, and the
pigs—especially the new litter of pigs, with
their pink skins and funny little wrinkled
noses—how could they make up their minds
to leave them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, just when everything looked most
hopeless, came a pleasant surprise. The
farmer’s wife, with whom they had been
boarded, said she had become so attached to
them, and had found them so helpful and such
good company, that she wanted them to stay
two whole weeks more; yes, she did! And
she said they were the best-mannered children
she had ever had in her house, besides!</p>

<p>These compliments pleased Sam and Billy
as much as they did the three children to
whom they referred, and little Maysie resolved
to repeat them to Mother the next time she
was reproved for her manners.</p>

<p>As for Jack the Fire-dog, after the arrival
of the three city children he spent more time
than ever on Mr. Ledwell’s premises. Since
he could not be with his old engine and
his beloved company, he could feel interest
in no other engine; but there were
the dear children, and Jack had always been
accustomed to the company of children and
could not live without them. So by degrees
Jack established himself on the Ledwell estate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and from sleeping there on extremely hot
nights came to sleep there every night. It
was very pleasant sleeping under the large
elms, with the sea-breezes wafted to him, or
on cool nights, in the roomy stable, where
he could smell the sweet hay overhead and
hear the bull pups nestling in their sleep
in their box from the room beyond; for the
mother of the pups had become reconciled to
Jack since he had no intention of hurting her
babies, and even allowed him to play with
them, now they had grown large and strong.</p>

<p>It was a very fortunate thing for the pups
and their mother and the horses and every
one on the place, too, that Jack had seen fit
to take up his abode on the premises—but
we will tell what happened.</p>

<p>One night when the man whose duty it
was to close the stable was about to lock up,
he caught sight of Jack lying under the large
elm-tree in front of the stable.</p>

<p>“‘Twill be cold, old boy, before morning,”
he said to Jack as he held the door open,
“and I advise you to come inside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack had been thinking the same thing
himself, so he got up and went in to his bed
in the harness-room. The heavy door was
rolled to and locked, and the man went upstairs
to his room on the floor above.</p>

<p>A night-watchman is usually employed
where valuable horses are kept, and usually
there was one on Mr. Ledwell’s place, but
for the past two nights he had been at his
home ill from a cold, and the premises were
left unguarded.</p>

<p>Jack curled up in his comfortable bed,
listening for a while to the heavy steps of
the men overhead, the occasional stamping
from the horses’ stalls, or the rattling of their
halter chains against their iron mangers; to
the occasional nestling of the pups as they
stirred in their sleep and crowded one another
in their attempts to obtain more room; to
the rising wind that shook the drooping
boughs of the big elm outside. It was very
pleasant to listen to these sounds from his
comfortable bed in the harness-room, and,
while listening to them, Jack fell asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
He had acquired the habit of sleeping with
one ear open during his old life in the engine-house,
and the habit was so firmly rooted
that it would never leave him. This night
he awoke every few minutes, starting at
every sound. Once he jumped to his feet,
dreaming that he was in the old engine-house,
and that the gong had just struck.</p>

<p>It was no gong, however, but only the
sharp noise made by one of the horses as he
gave his halter chain a sudden jerk, and
Jack was wide awake now and listening with
all his might.</p>

<p>What makes the Fire-Dog so restless, and
why does he keep his keen nose up in the
air, sniffing so eagerly, then suddenly start
to his feet and run about the floor of the
large stable, peering in at every corner and
cranny, and then with a whine dart up the
staircase leading to the floor above? The
wire door used in summer time swings inward,
and as Jack bounds against it, it flies open and
he stands inside. It is a good-sized room with
two beds in it, the occupants fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no doubt now as to what brought
Jack here. A decided smell of smoke pervades
the room, increasing every moment,
oozing through the crevices of the partition
which separates this room from the lofts beyond,
where the hay is stored. The turned-down
lamp that is always kept lighted at
night, in case of a sudden call, shows dimly
through the gathering haze, and the Fire-Dog
knows that there is not a moment to
lose. With one leap he stands by the side
of the man who let him into the stable a few
hours before. He is fast asleep, and Jack’s
loud barks only cause him to stir and turn
over in his sleep. But the Fire-Dog has not
been brought up in an engine-house for
nothing, and he knows the horrors of a fire
at night. He now pounces upon the heavy
sleeper, pawing him frantically with his
strong paws, while his loud barking is shrill
with the warning he tries so hard to express.</p>

<p>He succeeds at last in rousing the heavy
sleeper and at the same time the occupants
of the other bed. They take in the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
at once, and in an instant are on their feet.
They snatch up some articles of clothing and
run for the stairs, putting them on as they
go. The rolling door is thrown open, and
their voices send out the startling cry of
“Fire! Fire!”</p>

<p>The loud cry is borne on the night air to
the stable beyond, where the farm-horses and
cows are kept, and where other men are
sleeping, and there the alarm is taken up and
sent on to the house, where the family are
fast asleep.</p>

<p>There is nothing that arouses one more
suddenly and fills one with more alarm than
the cry of “Fire!” in the middle of the
night. In a few minutes all the people
living on the place are aroused. The alarm
is sounded for the only engine in town, but
what can one engine a mile distant accomplish
when a stable filled with hay is on fire?</p>

<p>The first thought is for the horses; and
they, terrified at the noise and excitement
and fast-gaining fire, refuse to leave their
stalls, running back when they are released<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
so soon as they catch sight of the flames. So
blankets and carriage robes are hastily caught
up and thrown over their heads, that they
may not see the flames, and in that way they
are led through the burning stable in safety
and turned loose in the field, where they
stand watching the commotion about them
and snorting with terror.</p>

<p>Then the carriages are run out and harnesses
caught down from the pegs where they
hang, and carried to a place of safety.
Meanwhile the fire steadily sweeps on its
way, bursting through the roof and sending
volumes of smoke and flame high up into the
dark sky. The big elm that drooped its
graceful branches over the burning building,
shivers and moans like a live creature in pain,
as the tongues of flame lick its fresh green
leaves and shrivel them with their hot breath.</p>

<p>Every man and woman on the place is
awake and on the spot, and the high wind is
taking the smoke and flames of the burning
building directly in the line of the stable
where the farm-horses and cows are kept.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
These are taken out blindfolded, as the horses
in the other stable have been, for the heat
from the burning hay, the summer’s heavy
crop, is intense, and the strong wind hurls
blazing embers against the shingled roof.</p>

<p>It is evident that this stable will go like
the other before long, and men are on the
roof, stamping out the fire as often as it
catches on the dry shingles. Then they do
what is often done in country towns where
the fire department is of little use. Two
lines of men and women stand between the
farm-stable and the well, while pails are
hurriedly filled with water and passed from
hand to hand along one line until they finally
are handed up to the men on the roof, to be
dashed over the heated shingles. Then the
empty pails are passed down the other line to
the well. In this way, the roof is kept wet
and the burning embers are made harmless.
Before the pails have been passed along the
lines many times, the engine comes tearing
up the driveway, the horses at full speed, and
draws up before the burning stable. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
too late to be of any service there, but the
other buildings can be saved, and the hose is
quickly unwound and attached to the well.
The deep thuds of the working engine are
soon heard, and the hose is turned upon the
farm-stable. Every throb of the engine sends
the water higher and higher, until a broad,
full stream strikes the ridgepole and sends
rivulets running over the surface of the slanting
roof. In less than five minutes more
service is done than the lines of hard-working
men and women could accomplish in an hour.</p>

<p>All this time the Fire-Dog, but for whose
warning many lives would have been lost, is
going in and out among the workers, with
the same air of responsibility that he had
always worn in the old days when he went
to fires with Company 33. He threads his
way among the crowd, which has collected,
exactly as he used to, looking about to assure
himself that everything is as it should be.
When Sam and Billy appear on the scene,
excited and awestruck, he stations himself by
their side and never leaves them for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
instant, as if he fears harm might come to
them if he were not there to watch over
them.</p>

<p>The anxiety comes to an end at last. The
stable where the fire started is a pile of black
and smoking embers, but the farm-stable
with its sheds and paddocks is saved, and
not a life lost, even to the kittens and
puppies; and of old Jack, whose sagacity
has brought this about, what a hero they
make when the story is made known! The
children cannot love him any more, because
they already love him as much as they can,
but every man and woman on the place
has a kind word and a caress for the faithful
Fire-Dog. If he were not the most modest
dog that ever lived, his head would certainly
be turned, for the facts even reach the newspapers,
and the whole story is told that everybody
may read it. It does not make him one
bit conceited, the dear old Fire-Dog, and he
would do the same thing right over again,
even if every hair on his body should be
singed. When, however, a handsome collar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
with a broad brass plate, on which is engraved
in large letters</p>

<p class='center'>
JACK THE FIRE-DOG<br />
<br />
<small>PRESENTED BY</small>br />
<br />
HIS GRATEFUL FRIENDS,<br />
</p>

<p class='unindent'>is placed on his neck, then you may be sure
his heart swells with pride and gratitude.</p>

<p>If only there were time enough, how we
should like to tell a little more about Jack’s
friends,—how Sam grew up to be a man
very like his grandfather and made a great
many people happy; how Billy grew strong
and manly and at last became an artist and
was able to make a comfortable home for his
mother; how the three city children went
home well and happy and came back for
many summers, until Johnny was old enough
to take a position in Mr. Ledwell’s business,
where he made himself so useful that he rose
a little higher in position each year; how
helpful Hannah became to Mother, and what
good care she took of the pretty house to
which they moved in the beautiful town of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Seaport; how Maysie turned out to be a very
capable business woman; how Father enjoyed
the new home in the country, and did not so
often come home tired as he used to in the
city.</p>

<p>We can only hint briefly at these things,
however, for it is time to say good-bye to the
dear old Fire-Dog and his friends.</p>
